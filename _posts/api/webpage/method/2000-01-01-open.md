`open(url, callback)` {void}
`open(url, method, callback)` {void}
`open(url, method, data, callback)` {void}

Opens the `url` and loads it to the page. Once the page is loaded, the optional `callback` is called using `page.onLoadFinished`, and also provides the page status to the function (`'success'` or `'fail'`).

## Examples

### GET google.com and report "success" or "fail"

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();

page.open('http://www.google.com/', function(status) {
  console.log('Status: ' + status);
  // Do other things here...
});
```

### POST data to google.com and report "success" or "fail"

As of PhantomJS 1.2, the open function can be used to request a URL with methods other than GET. This syntax also includes the ability to specify data to be sent with the request. In the following example, we make a request using the POST method, and include some basic data.

```javascript
var webPage = require('webpage');
var page = webPage.create();
var postBody = 'user=username&password=password';

page.open('http://www.google.com/', 'POST', postBody, function(status) {
  console.log('Status: ' + status);
  // Do other things here...
});
```
