**Note** Binary packages are made available on a volunteer basis. There is no need to
ask when a binary package for a given platform will be ready. The packagers are fully aware of every source release and they give their best effort to make the binaries available.

Download service is kindly provided by [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads). Previous releases download was provided by [Google Code Project Hosting](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/downloads/).

## Windows

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-windows.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-windows.zip) (19.4 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The executable `phantomjs.exe` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of Windows Vista or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt, WebKit, or any other libraries.

## Mac OS X

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-macosx.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-macosx.zip) (13.7 MB) and extract (unzip) the content.

The binary `bin/phantomjs` is ready to use.

**Note**: For this static build, the binary is self-contained with no external dependency. It will run on a fresh install of OS X 10.7 (Lion) or later versions. There is no requirement to install Qt or any other libraries.

**Note**: OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) users will need to unpack this binary using UPX (Otherwise the app exists with error message "Killed 9"). 
```shell
brew install upx
upx -d phantomjs
```

## Linux

Binary packages for Linux are still being prepared. There are still issues to be solved until a static build is available (see [issue 12948](https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/issues/12948) for more details).

In the mean time, it is recommended that you build the Linux version from source.

## Source Code

Download [phantomjs-2.0.0-source.zip](https://bitbucket.org/ariya/phantomjs/downloads/phantomjs-2.0.0-source.zip) (105 MB) and follow the [build instructions]({{ site.url }}/build.html).
