#   Xsun on Solaris 2.5.1:
#   	Patches are available for Solaris 2.6, 7, and 8 but
#   	not for Solaris 2.5.1.
#   HP-UX:
#   	Patches are available for HP-UX 10.20, 11.00, and 11.11.
#   AIX 4.3.3 and AIX 5.1:
#   	Headers are clearly broken on all AIX versions, and we
#   	don't know of any patches. The strange thing is that we
#   	did not get any reports about this issue until very
#   	recently, long after gcc 3.0.x was released. It seems to
#   	work for us with gcc 2.95.2.
