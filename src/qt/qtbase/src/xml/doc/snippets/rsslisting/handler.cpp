/*
handler.cpp

Provides a handler for processing XML elements found by the reader.

The handler looks for <title> and <link> elements within <item> elements,
and records the text found within them. Link information stored within
rdf:about attributes of <item> elements is also recorded when it is
available.

For each item found, a signal is emitted which specifies its title and
link information. This may be used by user interfaces for the purpose of
displaying items as they are read.

    For all cases not explicitly checked for, we return true to indicate that
