The following is a list of all copyright notices and license statements which
appear in the xkbcommon source tree.

If making new contributions, the first form (i.e. Daniel Stone, Ran Benita,
etc) is vastly preferred.

All licenses are derivative of the MIT/X11 license, mostly identical other
than no-endorsement clauses (e.g. paragraph 4 of The Open Group's license).

These statements are split into two sections: one for the code compiled and
distributed as part of the libxkbcommon shared library and the code
component of all tests (i.e. everything under src/ and xkbcommon/, plus the
.c and .h files under test/), and another for the test data under test/data,
which is distributed with the xkbcommon source tarball, but not installed to
the system.
