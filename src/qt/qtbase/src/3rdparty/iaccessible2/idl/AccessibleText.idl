/** @brief This interface gives read-only access to text.

 The %IAccessibleText interface should be implemented by all components
  that present textual information on the display like  buttons,
  text entry fields, or text portions of the document window.  The interface
  provides access to the text's content, attributes, and spatial location.
  However, text can not be modified with this interface.  That is the task
  of the IAccessibleEditableText interface.

 The text length, i.e. the number of characters in the text, is
  returned by IAccessibleText::nCharacters. All methods that operate
  on particular characters (e.g. IAccessibleText::textAtOffset) use character
  indices from 0 to length-1. All methods that operate on character positions
  (e.g. IAccessibleText::text) use indices from 0 to length.

 Please note that accessible text does not necessarily support selection.
  In this case it should behave as if there where no selection.  An empty
  selection is used for example to express the current cursor position.

 Refer to @ref _specialOffsets
  "Special Offsets for use in the IAccessibleText and IAccessibleEditableText Methods"
  for information about special offsets that can be used in %IAccessibleText methods.

 E_FAIL is returned in the following cases
 @li endOffset < startOffset
 @li endoffset > length

  /** @brief Returns the bounding box of the specified position.

   The virtual character after the last character of the represented

    current input position and will therefore typically be queried by AT more
    often than other positions.  Because it does not represent an existing character
    its bounding box is defined in relation to preceding characters.  It should be
    roughly equivalent to the bounding box of some character when inserted at the
    end of the text.  Its height typically being the maximal height of all the
    characters in the text or the height of the preceding character, its width being
    at least one pixel so that the bounding box is not degenerate.

   Note that the index 'length' is not always valid.  Whether it is or not is
    implementation dependent.  It typically is when text is editable or otherwise
    when on the screen the caret can be placed behind the text.  You can be sure
