/** @brief This interface provides clipboard capability to text objects.

 This interface is typically used in conjunction with the IAccessibleText
  interface and complements that interface with the additional capability of
  clipboard operations.  Note that even a read only text object can support
  the copy capability so this interface is not limited to editable objects.

 The substrings used with this interface are specified as follows:
  If startOffset is less than endOffset, the substring starts with the
  character at startOffset and ends with the character just before endOffset.
  If endOffset is lower than startOffset,  the result is the same as a call
  with the two arguments exchanged. The whole text can be defined by passing
  the indices zero and IAccessibleText::nCharacters. If both indices have the
  same value, an empty string is defined.

 Refer to the @ref _specialOffsets
  "Special Offsets for use in the IAccessibleText and IAccessibleEditableText Methods"
  for information about a special offset constant that can be used in %IAccessibleEditableText methods.
