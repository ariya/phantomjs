/** @brief This interface gives access to the application's name and version information.

 This interface provides the AT with the information it needs to differentiate
 this application from other applications, from other versions of this
 application, or from other versions of this application running on different
 versions of an accessibility bridge or accessibility toolkit.

 Servers implementing IAccessible2 should provide access to the %IAccessibleApplication
 interface via QueryService from any object so that ATs can easily determine specific
 information about the application such as its name or version.
