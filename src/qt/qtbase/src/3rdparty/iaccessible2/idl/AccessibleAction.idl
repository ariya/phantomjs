/** @brief This interface gives access to actions that can be executed
  for accessible objects.

 Every accessible object that can be manipulated via the native GUI beyond the
  methods available either in the MSAA IAccessible interface or in the set of
  IAccessible2 interfaces (other than this IAccessibleAction interface) should
  support the IAccessibleAction interface in order to provide Assistive Technology
  access to all the actions that can be performed by the object.  Each action can
  be performed or queried for a name, description or associated key bindings.
  Actions are needed more for ATs that assist the mobility impaired, such as
  on-screen keyboards and voice command software.  By providing actions directly,
  the AT can present them to the user without the user having to perform the extra
  steps to navigate a context menu.

 The first action should be equivalent to the MSAA default action.  If there is
  only one action, %IAccessibleAction should also be implemented.

  /** @brief Returns an array of BSTRs describing one or more key bindings, if
   there are any, associated with the specified action.

   The returned strings are the localized human readable key sequences to be
   used to activate each action, e.g. "Ctrl+Shift+D".  Since these key
   sequences are to be used when the object has focus, they are like
   mnemonics (access keys), and not like shortcut (accelerator) keys.

   There is no need to implement this method for single action controls since
   that would be redundant with the standard MSAA programming practice of
   getting the mnemonic from get_accKeyboardShortcut.

   An AT such as an On Screen Keyboard might not expose these bindings but
   provide alternative means of activation.

   Note: the client allocates and passes in an array of pointers.  The server
   allocates the BSTRs and passes back one or more pointers to these BSTRs into
   the array of pointers allocated by the client.  The client is responsible
   for deallocating the BSTRs.
