/** @brief This interface gives access to a two-dimensional table.

 Typically all accessible objects that represent cells or cell-clusters of a table
  will be at the same time children of the table.  In this case IAccessible2::indexInParent
  will return the child index which then can be used when calling IAccessibleTable::rowIndex
  and IAccessibleTable::columnIndex.

 However, in some cases that kind of implementation will not be possible.  When
  the table cells are not direct children of a table, the object representing
  the cell can define a "table-cell-index" object attribute identifying the 0
  based table cell index.  This object attribute is obtained by parsing the
  attribute string returned by IAccessible2::attributes.  The "table-cell-index"
  attribute can be used just like a child index of the typical case.  ATs should
  first test for the presence of the "table-cell-index" attribute and if it is not
  present then IAccessible2::indexInParent can be used as in the typical case
  where cells are direct children of the table.

 The range of valid coordinates for this interface are implementation dependent.
  However, that range includes at least the intervals from the from the first row
  or column with the index 0 up to the last (but not including) used row or column
  as returned by IAccessibleTable::nRows and IAccessibleTable::nColumns.

 Note that newer implementations are now using IAccessibleTable2 and IAccessibleTableCell
  rather than this interface.
