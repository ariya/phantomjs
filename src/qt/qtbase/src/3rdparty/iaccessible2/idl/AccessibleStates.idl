 Used to indicate that the control is "pressed" and will be invoked when the

  mouse or synthesizes mouse events might need to know that, and possibly a talking
  interface would even let the user know about it.  It could also potentially be
  useful to on screen keyboards or test tools since the information does indicate
  something about the state of the interface, for example, code operating asynchronously
  might need to wait for the armed state to change before doing something else.

  MSAA's EVENT_OBJECT_FOCUS.  In a future release a new event mechanism may be
  added to provide for event specific data to be passed with the event.  At that

 An object has this state when its parent object has the state ::IA2_STATE_MANAGES_DESCENDANTS.
 For example, a list item object may be managed by its parent list object and may only
 exist as long as the object is actually rendered.  Similarly a table cell's accessible
 object may exist only while the cell has focus.  However, from the perspective of an
 assistive technology a transient object behaves like a non-transient object.  As a
 result it is likely that this state is not of use to an assistive technology, but it
 is provided in case an assistive technology determines that knowledge of the transient
 nature of the object is useful and also for harmony with the Linux accessibility API.

 The standard checkable objects are check boxes, radio buttons, check box menu
 items, radio menu items, and toggle buttons.  Since assistive technology will
 determine that these objects are checkable via the object's role the checkable
 state is not required.  However, this state is necessary in those cases where
 an object has a role which is not one of the previously mentioned roles.  An
 example is a table cell which indicates whether or not an email has an attachment,
 whether or not an mail is considered spam, and whether or not an email has been read.
