/** @brief This interface exposes information about hypertext in a document.

 The %IAccessibleHypertext interface is the main interface to expose
  hyperlinks in a document, typically a text document, that are used
  to reference other documents.  A typical implementation is to implement
  this interface on the smallest text object such as a paragraph of text.
