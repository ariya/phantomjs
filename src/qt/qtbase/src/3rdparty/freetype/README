  Special notes to Unix users
  ===========================

  Please  read  the file  `docs/UPGRADE.UNIX'.  It contains  important
  information regarding the installation  of FreeType on Unix systems,
  especially GNU based operating systems like GNU/Linux.

  FreeType 2's  library is called `libfreetype',  FreeType 1's library
  is called `libttf'.  They are *not* compatible!


  FreeType 2.3.12
  ===============

  Please   read   the  docs/CHANGES   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION.

  Read the files `docs/INSTALL' for installation instructions.

  The FreeType 2 API reference is located in `docs/reference'; use the
  file   `ft2-doc.html'   as   the   top  entry   point.    Additional
  documentation is available as a separate package from our sites.  Go
  to

    http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/freetype/

  and download one of the following files.

    freetype-doc-2.3.12.tar.bz2

  Bugs
  ====

  Please report bugs  by e-mail to `freetype-devel@nongnu.org'.  Don't
  forget to  send a  detailed explanation of  the problem --  there is
  nothing  worse than  receiving a  terse message  that only  says `it
  doesn't work'.

  Alternatively, you may submit a bug report at

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=freetype


  Enjoy!
