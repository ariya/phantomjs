# The HDRMACRO is already defined in FTJam and is used to add

# project easily.

# This is prepended to FT2_INCLUDE_DIR.  It can be used to specify

# versions of `ftmodule.h' and `ftoption.h', for example.
#

# The list of modules to compile on any given build of the library.
# By default, this will contain _all_ modules defined in FT2_SRC_DIR.

#            if you modify this list or provide your own.
