CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.11 and 2.3.12

  I. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - For  `FT_Open_Face',  new  parameters  are  available  to ignore
      preferred family names: FT_PARAM_TAG_IGNORE_PREFERRED_FAMILY and
      FT_PARAM_TAG_IGNORE_PREFERRED_SUBFAMILY.

  II. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Support  for  incremental  font  loading  (controlled  with  the
      FT_CONFIG_OPTION_INCREMENTAL macro) is now active by default.

    - Better support for vertical metrics.

    - Various minor bug fixes.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.10 and 2.3.11

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Version 2.3.10 broke PCF support.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.10 and 2.3.9

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - If all  ASCII digits in a  font have the  same (unscaled) width,
      the autohinter respects this and won't change it.

    - TrueType fonts  are now  rasterized correctly  if the horizontal
      and vertical resolution differ.

    - Type 1 fonts are now handled with increased precision internally
      to avoid serious rounding issues if non-integral coordinates are
      encountered.

    - Horizontally  condensed CFF  fonts (using the font  matrix) were
      rendered  incorrectly.   This  bug  has  been  introduced  after
      release 2.3.5.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Support for the SFNT cmap 13 table format (as defined by the new
      OpenType 1.6 specification) has been added.

    - B/W rasterization  of well-hinted TrueType  fonts at small sizes
      has been greatly improved.

    - Calculation  of  vertical  metrics in  OpenType  fonts has  been
      improved.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - It  is now  possible to  change  the emboldening  factor in  the
      `ftview' demo program with keys `e' and `E'.

    - It is  now possible  to change the  slant value in  the `ftview'
      demo program with keys `s' and `S'.

    - The  5-levels  grayscale  mode of  the `ftraster'  module (which
      FreeType doesn't use by default) was broken since version 2.3.0.

    - Compilation of the  `ftgrays' and `ftraster' modules  was broken
      in stand-alone mode.

    - Various fixes for compilation on 64bit and 16bit architectures.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.9 and 2.3.8

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Very unfortunately, FreeType 2.3.8 contained a change that broke
      its  official ABI.  The  end result  is  that programs  compiled
      against previous versions of the library, but dynamically linked
      to  2.3.8 can  experience  memory corruption  if  they call  the
      `FT_Get_PS_Font_Info' function.

      We recommend all users to  upgrade to 2.3.9 as soon as possible,
      or to downgrade to a previous  release of the library if this is
      not an option.

      The  origin of the  bug is  that a  new field  was added  to the
      publicly  defined  `PS_FontInfoRec'  structure.   Unfortunately,
      objects of this  type can be stack or  heap allocated by callers
      of   `FT_Get_PS_Font_Info',  resulting   in   a  memory   buffer
      overwrite with its implementation in 2.3.8.

      If  you want to  know whether  your code  is vulnerable  to this
      issue,  simply  search  for  the  substrings  `PS_FontInfo'  and
      `PS_Font_Info' in your source code.  If none is found, your code
      is safe and is not affected.

      The FreeType team apologizes for the problem.

    - The POSIX support  of MacOS resource-fork fonts  (Suitcase fonts
      and LaserWriter Type1 PostScript fonts) was broken in 2.3.8.  If
      FreeType2 is built without Carbon framework, these fonts are not
      handled correctly.  Version 2.3.7 didn't have this bug.

    - `FT_Get_Advance' (and `FT_Get_Advances') returned bad values for
      almost all font formats except TrueType fonts.

    - Fix a bug  in the SFNT  kerning table  loader/parser which could
      crash the engine if certain malformed tables were encountered.

    - Composite SFNT bitmaps are now handled correctly.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The   new  functions   `FT_Get_CID_Is_Internally_CID_keyed'  and
      `FT_Get_CID_From_Glyph_Index'  can be  used to  access CID-keyed
      CFF fonts  via CID  values.  This code  has been  contributed by
      Michael Toftdal.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - `FT_Outline_Get_InsideBorder'  returns   FT_STROKER_BORDER_RIGHT
      for empty outlines.  This was incorrectly documented.

    - The `ftview' demo program now supports UTF-8 encoded strings.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.8 and 2.3.7

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - CID-keyed fonts in an SFNT wrapper were not handled correctly.

    - The smooth renderer produced truncated images (on the right) for
      outline parts with negative horizontal values.  Most fonts don't
      contain outlines left  to the y coordinate axis, but  the effect
      was very noticeable for outlines processed with FT_Glyph_Stroke,
      using thick strokes.

    - `FT_Get_TrueType_Engine_Type'  returned a  wrong  value if  both
      configuration  macros  TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER and
      TT_CONFIG_OPTION_UNPATENTED_HINTING were defined.

    - The  `face_index'  field  in   the  `FT_Face'  structure  wasn't
      initialized properly after calling FT_Open_Face and friends with
      a positive face index for CFFs,  WinFNTs, and, most importantly,
      for TrueType Collections (TTCs).


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Rudimentary support for Type 1  fonts and CID-keyed Type 1 fonts
      in an SFNT wrapper has been  added -- such fonts are used on the
      Mac.  The core  SFNT tables `TYP1' and `CID '  are passed to the
      PS Type 1  and CID-keyed PS font drivers;  other tables (`ALMX',
      `BBOX', etc.) are not supported yet.

    - A  new interface  to extract  advance values  of glyphs  without
      loading their outlines has been added.  The functions are called
      `FT_Get_Advance' and `FT_Get_Advances'; they are defined in file
      `ftadvanc.h' (to be accessed as FT_ADVANCES_H).

    - A new function `FT_Get_FSType_Flags' (in FT_FREETYPE_H) has been
      contributed  by   David  Bevan  to  access   the  embedding  and
      subsetting restriction information of fonts.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - FT_MulFix is now an inlined function; by default, assembler code
      is provided for x86 and ARM.  See FT_CONFIG_OPTION_INLINE_MULFIX
      and FT_CONFIG_OPTION_NO_ASSEMBLER (in ftoption.h) for more.

    - The handling of `tricky' fonts  (this is, fonts which don't work
      with the  autohinter, needing the font  format's hinting engine)
      has been generalized and changed slightly:

      . A new  face flag  FT_FACE_FLAG_TRICKY indicates that  the font
        format's  hinting engine is  necessary for  correct rendering.
        The macro FT_IS_TRICKY can be used to check this flag.

      . FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING is now ignored for tricky fonts.  To really
        force  raw  loading  of  such fonts  (without  hinting),  both
        FT_LOAD_NO_HINTING  and FT_LOAD_NO_AUTOHINT  must  be used  --
        this is something which you probably never want to do.

      . Tricky  TrueType fonts  always use  the  bytecode interpreter,
        either the patented or unpatented version.

    - The  function  `FT_GlyphSlot_Own_Bitmap'  has  been  moved  from
      FT_SYNTHESIS_H to FT_BITMAP_H; it  is now part of the `official'
      API.   (The functions  in  FT_SYNTHESIS_H are  still subject  to
      change, however.)

    - In the  `ftdiff'  demo  program you  can now  toggle the  use of
      FT_LOAD_IGNORE_GLOBAL_ADVANCE_WIDTH with key `a'.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.7 and 2.3.6

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - If the library  was compiled on an i386  platform using gcc, and
      compiler  option -O3 was  given, `FT_MulFix'  sometimes returned
      incorrect  results   which  could  have   caused  problems  with
      `FT_Request_Metrics'   and  `FT_Select_Metrics',   returning  an
      incorrect descender size.

    - Pure CFFs without  subfonts were scaled incorrectly  if the font
      matrix  was  non-standard.  This  bug  has  been  introduced  in
      version 2.3.6.

    - The  `style_name'  field  in  the  `FT_FaceRec'  structure often
      contained  a wrong  value for  Type 1  fonts.  This misbehaviour
      has been  introduced  in  version  2.3.6  while  trying  to  fix
      another   problem.   [Note,  however,   that   this   value   is
      informative only  since  the  used  algorithm to  extract  it is
      very simplistic.]


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Two      new      macros,      FT_OUTLINE_SMART_DROPOUTS     and
      FT_OUTLINE_EXCLUDE_STUBS,  have been introduced.   Together with
      FT_OUTLINE_IGNORE_DROPOUTS (which  was ignored previously) it is
      now possible to control the dropout mode  of the `raster' module
      (for B&W rasterization),   using  the   `flags'  field   in  the
      `FT_Outline' structure.

    - The TrueType bytecode interpreter now passes the dropout mode to
      the B&W rasterizer.  This greatly increases the output for small
      ppem values of many fonts like `pala.ttf'.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.6 and 2.3.5

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - A  bunch of  potential security  problems have  been found.  All
      users should update.

    - Microsoft  Unicode  cmaps  in  TrueType  fonts  are  now  always
      preferred over Apple cmaps.  This is not a bug per se, but there
      exist some buggy  fonts created for MS which  have broken  Apple
      cmaps.  This affects  only the automatic  selection of FreeType;
      it's always possible to manually select an Apple Unicode cmap if
      desired.

    - Many bug fixes to the TrueType bytecode interpreter.

    - Improved Mac support.

    - Subsetted CID-keyed CFFs are now supported correctly.

    - CID-keyed CFFs with subfonts which are scaled in a  non-standard
      way are now handled correctly.

    - A call to FT_Open_Face with `face_index' < 0 crashed FreeType if
      the font was a Windows (bitmap) FNT/FON.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The new function `FT_Get_CID_Registry_Ordering_Supplement' gives
      access to  those fields in a CID-keyed font.  The code  has been
      contributed by Derek Clegg.

    - George Williams  contributed  code  to validate  the new  `MATH'
      OpenType  table (within  the `otvalid'  module).  The  `ftvalid'
      demo program has been extended accordingly.

    - An API for cmap 14 support  (for Unicode Variant Selectors, UVS)
      has been contributed by George Williams.

    - A new face flag FT_FACE_FLAG_CID_KEYED has been added,  together
      with a macro FT_IS_CID_KEYED which evaluates to 1 if the font is
      CID-keyed.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Build support for symbian has been contributed.

    - Better WGL4 glyph name support, contributed by Sergey Tolstov.

    - Debugging output of the  various FT_TRACEX macros is now sent to
      stderr.

    - The `ftview' demo program now provides artificial slanting too.

    - The `ftvalid' demo  program has a new  option `-f' to select the
      font index.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.5 and 2.3.4

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Some subglyphs in TrueType fonts were handled incorrectly due to
      a missing graphics state reinitialization.

    - Large .Z files  (as distributed with some X11  packages) weren't
      handled correctly, making FreeType increase the heap stack in an
      endless loop.

    - A large  number of  bugs have  been fixed  to avoid  crashes and
      endless loops with invalid fonts.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The  two new  cache functions  `FTC_ImageCache_LookupScaler' and
      `FTC_SBit_Cache_LookupScaler' have been added to allow lookup of
      glyphs using an  `FTC_Scaler' object;  this makes it possible to
      use fractional pixel sizes in the cache.  The demo programs have
      been updated accordingly to use this feature.

    - A new API  `FT_Get_CMap_Format' has been added to  get the  cmap
      format  of a  TrueType font.   This  is useful  in handling  PDF
      files.  The code has been contributed by Derek Clegg.

    - The  auto-hinter  now  produces  better  output  by  default for
      non-Latin scripts  like Indic.   This was done by  using the CJK
      hinting module  as the default instead of the Latin one.  Thanks
      to Rahul Bhalerao for this suggestion.

    - A new API `FT_Face_CheckTrueTypePatents'  has been added to find
      out  whether  a  given  TrueType  font  uses  patented  bytecode
      instructions.   The  `ft2demos' bundle  contains a  new  program
      called `ftpatchk' which demonstrates its usage.

    - A  new  API  `FT_Face_SetUnpatentedHinting'  has  been  added to
      enable or disable the unpatented hinter.

    - Support for Windows FON files in PE format  has been contributed
      by Dmitry Timoshkov.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Vincent Richomme contributed Visual C++ project files for Pocket
      PCs.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.4 and 2.3.3

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - A serious  bug  in  the  handling  of bitmap  fonts (and  bitmap
      strikes of outline fonts) has been introduced in 2.3.3.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.3 and 2.3.2

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Remove a serious regression in the TrueType bytecode interpreter
      that was introduced  in version 2.3.2.  Note that  this does not
      disable  the  improvements  introduced  to  the  interpreter  in
      version 2.3.2,  only some ill  cases that occurred  with certain
      fonts (though a few popular ones).

    - The auto-hinter now  ignores single-point contours for computing
      blue zones.   This bug  created `wavy' baselines  when rendering
      text  with  various  fonts  that  use these  contours  to  model
      mark-attach points  (these are points that  are never rasterized
      and are placed outside of the glyph's real outline).

    - The `rsb_delta' and `lsb_delta' glyph slot fields are now set to
      zero for mono-spaced fonts.  Otherwise code that uses them would
      essentially ruin the fixed-advance property.

    - Fix  CVE-2007-1351 which  can  cause an  integer overflow  while
      parsing  BDF fonts,  leading to  a potentially  exploitable heap
      overflow condition.


  II. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Fixed compilation issues on some 64-bit platforms (see ChangeLog
      for details).

    - A new demo  program `ftdiff' has been added  to compare TrueType
      hinting, FreeType's auto  hinting, and rendering without hinting
      in three columns.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.2 and 2.3.1

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - FreeType  returned incorrect  kerning information  from TrueType
      fonts when the bytecode  interpreter was enabled.  This happened
      due to a typo introduced in version 2.3.0.

    - Negative  kerning  values  from   PFM  files  are  now  reported
      correctly  (they were read  as 16-bit  unsigned values  from the
      file).

    - Fixed  a small  memory leak  when `FT_Init_FreeType'  failed for
      some reason.

    - The Postscript hinter placed and sized very thin and ghost stems
      incorrectly.

    - The TrueType bytecode  interpreter has been fixed to  get rid of
      most of the  rare differences seen in comparison  to the Windows
      font loader.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The auto-hinter  now better deals  with serifs and  corner cases
      (e.g.,  glyph '9'  in Arial  at 9pt,  96dpi).  It  also improves
      spacing  adjustments and doesn't  change widths  for non-spacing
      glyphs.

    - Many   Mac-specific   functions   are  deprecated   (but   still
      available);  modern replacements  have been  provided  for them.
      See the documentation in file `ftmac.h'.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.1 and 2.3.0

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The TrueType interpreter sometimes returned incorrect horizontal
      metrics due to a bug in the handling of the SHZ instruction.

    - A typo  in  a  security  check  introduced  after  version 2.2.1
      prevented FreeType to render some glyphs in CFF fonts.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.3.0 and 2.2.1

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The  PCF font  loader  is  now much  more  robust while  loading
      malformed font files.

    - Various memory leaks have been found and fixed.

    - The TrueType name loader now deals properly with some fonts that
      encode their  names in UTF-16 (the specification  was vague, and
      the code incorrectly assumed UCS-4).

    - Fixed the TrueType bytecode  loader to deal properly with subtle
      monochrome/gray  issues  when   scaling  the  CVT.   Some  fonts
      exhibited bad rendering artifacts otherwise.

    - `FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden' now  supports vertical layouts correctly
      (it mangled the vertical advance height).

    - Fixed byte  endian issues  of `ftmac.c' to  support Mac OS  X on
      i386.

    - The  PFR  font loader  no  longer  erroneously  tags font  files
      without any outlines as FT_FACE_FLAG_SCALABLE.


  II. NEW API FUNCTIONS

    - `FT_Library_SetLcdFilter' allows you  to select a special filter
      to be  applied to the bitmaps generated  by `FT_Render_Glyph' if
      one of the FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD and FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V modes has
      been  selected.  This filter  is used  to reduce  color fringes;
      several  settings are  available  through the  FT_LCD_FILTER_XXX
      enumeration.

      Its  declaration   and  documentation  can  be   found  in  file
      `include/freetype/ftlcdfil.h'   (to  be   accessed   with  macro
      FT_LCD_FILTER_H).

      *IMPORTANT*:     This      function     returns     an     error
      (FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature) in default  builds of the library
      for patent reasons.  See below.

    - `FT_Get_Gasp'  allows you  to query  the flags  of  the TrueType
      `gasp' table for  a given character pixel size.   This is useful
      to duplicate  the text rendering  of MS Windows when  the native
      bytecode  interpreter is  enabled (which  isn't the  default for
      other patent reasons).

      Its  declaration   and  documentation  can  be   found  in  file
      `include/freetype/ftgasp.h'   (to   be   accessed   with   macro
      FT_GASP_H).


  III. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The auto-hinter has been tuned a lot to improve its results with
      serif fonts, resulting in much better font rendering of many web
      pages.

    - The unpatented  hinter is now part  of the default  build of the
      library; we  have added  code to automatically  support `tricky'
      fonts that need it.

      This means  that FreeType should `just work'  with certain Asian
      fonts, like  MingLiU, which cannot properly be  loaded without a
      bytecode interpreter,  but which fortunately  do not use  any of
      the patented  bytecode opcodes.  We detect these  fonts by name,
      so please  report any font file  that doesn't seem  to work with
      FreeType, and  we shall do what we  can to support it  in a next
      release.

      Note  that  the API  hasn't  changed,  so  you can  still  force
      unpatented hinting with a special parameter to `FT_Open_Face' as
      well.  This  might be useful in  same cases; for  example, a PDF
      reader might present  a user option to activate  it to deal with
      certain  `tricky'   embedded  fonts  which   cannot  be  clearly
      identified.

      If you are  a developer for embedded systems,  you might want to
      *disable*  the   feature  to  save  code   space  by  undefining
      TT_CONFIG_OPTION_UNPATENTED_HINTING in file `ftoption.h'.

    - LCD-optimized rendering is now  *disabled* in all default builds
      of  the  library,  mainly   due  to  patent  issues.   For  more
      information see:

      http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/freetype/2006-09/msg00064.html

      A  new  configuration macro  FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING
      has been introduced in  `ftoption.h'; manually define it in this
      file if you want to re-enable the feature.

      The  change only  affects the  implementation, not  the FreeType
      API.  This means that clients don't need to be modified, because
      the library still generates  LCD decimated bitmaps, but with the
      added constraint that R=G=B on each triplet.

      The  displayed result  should  be equal  to normal  anti-aliased
      rendering.

      Additionally,  if   FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING  is  not
      defined, the new  `FT_Library_SetLcdFilter' function returns the
      FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature error code.

    - Some computation bugs in  the TrueType bytecode interpreter were
      found,  which  allow us  to  get rid  of  very  subtle and  rare
      differences we had experienced with the Windows renderer.

    - It is now possible to cross-compile the library easily.  See the
      file `docs/INSTALL.CROSS' for details.

    - The file `src/base/ftmac.c' now contains code for Mac OS X only;
      its  deprecated function  `FT_GetFile_From_Mac_Font_Name' always
      returns an  error even if the QuickDraw  framework is available.
      The previous version has been moved to `builds/mac/ftmac.c'.

      Selecting  configure option `--with-quickdraw-carbon'  makes the
      build process use the original `ftmac.c' file instead of the Mac
      OS X-only version.


  IV. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Various performance and memory footprint optimizations have been
      performed on  the TrueType and CFF font  loaders, sometimes with
      very drastic  benefits (e.g., the  TrueType loader is  now about
      25% faster;  FreeType should use  less heap memory  under nearly
      all conditions).

    - The anti-aliased rasterizer has been optimized and is now 15% to
      25%  percent  faster than  in  previous  versions, depending  on
      content.

    - The Type 1 loader has been improved; as an example, it now skips
      top-level dictionaries properly.

    - Better support for Mac  fonts on POSIX systems, plus compilation
      fixes for Mac OS X on ppc64 where `ftmac.c' cannot be built.

    - Configuration  without `--with-old-mac-fonts'  does  not include
      `ftmac.c' (this was the behaviour in FreeType version 2.1.10).

    - The TrueTypeGX validator (gxvalid) checks the order of glyph IDs
      in the kern table.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.2.1 and 2.2

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Various integer overflows have been fixed.

    - PFB fonts with MacOS resource fork weren't  handled correctly on
      non-MacOS platforms.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.2 and 2.1.10

(not released officially)

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Vertical metrics for SFNT fonts were incorrect sometimes.

    - The FT_HAS_KERNING macro always returned 0.

    - CFF OpenType  fonts didn't  return correct vertical  metrics for
      glyphs with outlines.

    - If FreeType was compiled without hinters, all font formats based
      on PS outlines weren't scaled correctly.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Version 2.2 no longer exposes its internals, this is, the header
      files  located in  the `include/freetype/internal'  directory of
      the source package are not  copied anymore by the `make install'
      command.  Consequently, a number of rogue clients which directly
      access  FreeType's  internal   functions  and  structures  won't
      compile without modification.

      We provide  patches for  most of those  rogue clients.   See the
      following page for more information:

        http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/patches/rogue-patches.html

      Note that, as  a convenience to our Unix  desktop users, version
      2.2 is *binary* compatible with FreeType 2.1.7, which means that
      installing this  release on  an existing distribution  shall not
      break any working desktop.

    - FreeType's build  mechanism has been redesigned.   With GNU make
      it  is  now  sufficient  in   most  cases  to  edit  two  files:
      `modules.cfg',  to  select   the  library  components,  and  the
      configuration  file  `include/freetype/config/ftoption.h' (which
      can be copied to the objects directory).  Removing unused module
      directories   to    prevent   its   compilation    and   editing
      `include/freetype/config/ftmodule.h' is no longer necessary.

    - The  LIGHT  hinting algorithm  produces  more pleasant  results.
      Also, using the  FT_LOAD_TARGET_LIGHT flags within FT_Load_Glyph
      always forces auto-hinting, as a special exception.  This allows
      you to experiment with it  even if you have enabled the TrueType
      bytecode interpreter in your build.

    - The auto hinter now employs a new algorithm for CJK fonts, based
      on Akito  Hirai's patch.   Note that this  only works  for fonts
      with a Unicode charmap at the moment.

    - The following callback function  types have changed slightly (by
      adding the `const' keyword where appropriate):

        FT_Outline_MoveToFunc
        FT_Outline_LineToFunc
        FT_Outline_ConicToFunc
        FT_Outline_CubicToFunc
        FT_SpanFunc
        FT_Raster_RenderFunc

        FT_Glyph_TransformFunc
        FT_Renderer_RenderFunc
        FT_Renderer_TransformFunc

      Note that this doesn't affect binary backward compatibility.

    - On MacOS,  new APIs have  been added as replacements  for legacy
      APIs:  `FT_New_Face_From_FSRef'  for  `FT_New_Face_From_FSSpec',
      and              `FT_GetFile_From_Mac_ATS_Name'              for
      `FT_GetFile_From_Mac_Name'.  Legacy APIs are still available, if
      FreeType is built without disabling them.

    - A new  API `FT_Select_Size'  has been added  to select  a bitmap
      strike  by its  index.   Code using  other  functions to  select
      bitmap strikes should be updated to use this function.

    - A  new API  `FT_Get_SubGlyph_Info'  has been  added to  retrieve
      subglyph data.  This can be  used by rogue clients which used to
      access the internal headers to get the corresponding data.

    - In 2.1.10, the behaviour of `FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes' was changed for
      BDF/PCF fonts,  and only  for them.  This  causes inconsistency.
      In this release,  we undo the change.  The  intent of the change
      in 2.1.10  is to allow  size selection through  real dimensions,
      which can now be done through `FT_Request_Size'.

    - Some security  issues were discovered  and fixed in the  CFF and
      Type  1 loader, causing  crashes of  FreeType by  malformed font
      files.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The documentation  for FT_LOAD_TARGET_XXX and FT_RENDER_MODE_XXX
      values now better reflects its usage and differences: One set is
      used to specify the hinting algorithm, the other to specify  the
      pixel rendering mode.

    - `FT_New_Face' and `FT_New_Face_From_FSSpec' in ftmac.c have been
      changed to count supported scalable faces (sfnt, LWFN) only, and
      to  return the  number of  available faces  via face->num_faces.
      Unsupported bitmap faces (fbit, NFNT) are ignored.

    - builds/unix/configure  has been  improved for  MacOS X.   It now
      automatically checks available  functions in Carbon library, and
      prepare to use newest  functions by default.  Options to specify
      the  dependencies of  each Carbon  APIs (FSSpec,  FSRef, old/new
      QuickDraw, ATS)  are available too.  By manual  disabling of all
      QuickDraw   functionality,  FreeType   can   be  built   without
      `deprecated   function'   warnings    on   MacOS   10.4.x,   but
      FT_GetFile_Mac_Name  in  ftmac.c  then  is changed  to  a  dummy
      function, and returns an `unimplemented' error.  For details see
      builds/mac/README.

    - SFNT cmap handling has been  improved, mainly to run much faster
      with CJK fonts.

    - A   new  function   `FT_Get_TrueType_Engine_Type   (declared  in
      `FT_MODULE_H')  is  provided  to  determine the  status  of  the
      TrueType   bytecode  interpreter   compiled  into   the  library
      (patented, unpatented, unimplemented).

    - Vertical metrics of glyphs are  synthesized if the font does not
      provide such information.  You can tell whether  the metrics are
      synthesized or not by checking the FT_FACE_FLAG_VERTICAL flag of
      the face.

    - The demo programs  `ftview' and  `ftstring' have been  rewritten
      for better readability.   `ftview' has a new switch `-p' to test
      FT_New_Memory_Face (instead of FT_New_Face).

    - FreeType now honours bit 1 in the `head' table of TrueType fonts
      (meaning `left sidebearing point at x=0').  This helps with some
      buggy fonts.

    - Rudimentary support for Adobe's new `SING Glyphlet' format.  See

        http://www.adobe.com/products/indesign/sing_gaiji.html

      for more information.

    - The `ftdump'  program from the `ft2demos' bundle  now shows some
      information about charmaps.  It  also supports a new switch `-v'
      to increase verbosity.

    - Better AFM support.  This includes track kerning support.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.10 and 2.1.9

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The size comparison for BDF and PCF files could fail sometimes.

    - Some  CFF files  were still not  loaded  correctly.   Patch from
      Derek Noonburg.

    - The stroker still had some serious bugs.

    - Boris  Letocha  fixed a  bug in  the  TrueType interpreter:  The
      NPUSHW instruction wasn't skipped correctly in IF clauses.  Some
      fonts like `Helvetica 75 Bold' failed.

    - Another  serious  bug  in  handling  TrueType hints  caused many
      distortions.  It has been introduced in version 2.1.8, and it is
      highly recommended to upgrade.

    - FreeType didn't properly parse empty Type 1 glyphs.

    - An unbound dynamic buffer growth was fixed in the PFR loader.

    - Several bugs have been fixed in the cache sub-system.

    - FreeType behaved incorrectly when resizing two distinct but very
      close character pixel sizes through `FT_Set_Char_Size' (Savannah
      bug #12263).

    - The auto-hinter didn't work properly for fonts without a Unicode
      charmap -- it even refused to load the glyphs.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Many fixes have been applied to drastically reduce the amount of
      heap   memory   used   by   FreeType,   especially   when  using
      memory-mapped font files  (which is the default on Unix  systems
      which support them).

    - The auto-hinter  has been replaced with a new module, called the
      `auto-fitter'.  It consumes  less memory  than its  predecessor,
      and it is  prepared to support non-latin scripts  better in next
      releases.

    - George Williams  contributed code to read  kerning data from PFM
      files.

    - FreeType   now   uses    the   TT_NAME_ID_PREFERRED_FAMILY   and
      TT_NAME_ID_PREFERRED_SUBFAMILY   strings   (if   available)  for
      setting  family  and  style in SFNT  fonts  (patch from Kornfeld
      Eliyahu Peter).

    - A  new  API `FT_Sfnt_Table_Info'  (in FT_TRUETYPE_TABLES_H)  has
      been added to retrieve name and size information of SFNT tables.

    - A new API `FT_OpenType_Validate' (in FT_OPENTYPE_VALIDATE_H) has
      been added to validate OpenType tables  (BASE, GDEF, GPOS, GSUB,
      JSTF).   After validation  it is  no longer  necessary to  check
      for errors in those tables while accessing them.

      Note that  this module might  be moved to another library in the
      future  to avoid  a tight  dependency between  FreeType and  the
      OpenType specification.

    - A new API in FT_BITMAP_H  (`FT_Bitmap_New', `FT_Bitmap_Convert',
      `FT_Bitmap_Copy',  `FT_Bitmap_Embolden',  `FT_Bitmap_Done')  has
      been added.   Its  use is  to convert an  FT_Bitmap structure in
      1bpp, 2bpp,  4bpp, or 8bpp  format into  another 8bpp FT_Bitmap,
      probably using a different pitch, and to further manipulate it.

    - A new  API `FT_Outline_Embolden'  (in FT_OUTLINE_H) gives  finer
      control how  outlines are embolded.

    - `FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden' (in FT_SYNTHESIS_H)  now handles bitmaps
      also (code contributed  by Chia I Wu).  Note that this  function
      is still experimental and may be replaced with a better API.

    - The method  how BDF and PCF  bitmap fonts  are accessed has been
      refined.   Formerly,   FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes  and  FT_Set_Char_Size
      were  synonyms in  FreeType's  BDF and PCF interface.  This  has
      changed now.  FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes  should be  used to  select the
      actual  font dimensions  (the `strike',  which is the sum of the
      `FONT_ASCENT'    and    `FONT_DESCENT'    properties),     while
      FT_Set_Char_Size  selects  the  `nominal' size  (the `PIXELSIZE'
      property).  In both functions, the width parameter is ignored.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The BDF driver  no longer converts  all returned bitmaps  with a
      depth of 2bpp or 4bpp to a depth of 8bpp.  The documentation has
      not  mentioned  this  explicitly,  but  implementors  might have
      relied on this after looking into the source files.

    - A new option `--ftversion' has been  added to freetype-config to
      return the FreeType version.

    - The  memory  debugger  has  been  updated   to  dump  allocation
      statistics on  all allocation  sources in the library.   This is
      useful to  spot greedy  allocations when  loading and processing
      fonts.

    - We removed a huge array of constant pointers to constant strings
      in the `psnames' module.   The problem was that  compilations in
      PIC mode (i.e.,  when generating a  Unix shared object/dll)  put
      the array  into the non-shared  writable section of  the library
      since absolute pointers are not relocatable by nature.

      This reduces the memory consumption by approximately 16KByte per
      process linked  to FreeType.   We now also store  the array in a
      compressed form (as a trie) which saves about 20KByte of code as
      well.

    - Kirill  Smelkov provided  patches to make  src/raster/ftraster.c
      compile stand-alone again.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.9 and 2.1.8

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The function  `FT_Get_CharMap_Index' was only declared,  without
      any  real  code.   For  consistency,  it  has  been  renamed  to
      `FT_Get_Charmap_Index'.   (This function is needed  to implement
      cmap caches.)

    - `FT_Outline_Get_BBox'  sometimes returned  incorrect values  for
      conic outlines (e.g., for TrueType fonts).

    - Handling of `bhed' table has been fixed.

    - The TrueType driver with enabled byte code interpreter sometimes
      returned artifacts due to incorrect rounding.  This bug has been
      introduced after version 2.1.4.

    - The BDF driver dropped the last glyph in the font.

    - The BDF driver now uses the DEFAULT_CHAR property (if available)
      to select a glyph shape for the undefined glyph.

    - The stroker failed for closed outlines and single points.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - George  Williams   contributed  code  to   handle  Apple's  font
      distortion technology found in GX fonts (`avar', `cvar', `fvar',
      and `gvar' tables;  the Multiple Masters  API has been  slightly
      extended to cope with the new functionality).

    - The `FT_GlyphSlotRec' structure has been extended:  The elements
      `lsb_delta' and  `rsb_delta' give the difference  between hinted
      and  unhinted  left and right  side bearings  if autohinting  is
      active.  Using those values can improve the inter-letter spacing
      considerably.   See the documentation of  `FT_GlyphSlotRec'  and
      the `ftstring' demo program how to use it.

    - Loading TrueType and Type 1 fonts has been made much faster.

    - The stroker is  no longer experimental (but the  cache subsystem
      still is).


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - A new  documentation file  `formats.txt' describes various  font
      formats supported (and not supported) by FreeType.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.8 and 2.1.7

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The native  TrueType hinter contained some  bugs which prevented
      some fonts to be rendered correctly, most notably Legendum.otf.

    - The PostScript hinter now produces improved results.

    - The  linear advance  width  and height  values were  incorrectly
      rounded,  making  them virtually  unusable  if  not loaded  with
      FT_LOAD_LINEAR_DESIGN.

    - Indexing CID-keyed CFF fonts is  now working: The glyph index is
      correctly  treated as a  CID, similar  to FreeType's  CID driver
      module.  Note that CID CMap support is still missing.

    - The FT_FACE_FLAGS_GLYPH_NAMES flag is now  set correctly for all
      font formats.

    - Some subsetted Type 1  fonts weren't parsed correctly.  This bug
      has been introduced in 2.1.7.  In summary, the Type 1 parser has
      become more robust.

    - Non-decimal numbers weren't parsed correctly in PS fonts.

    - The WinFNT driver now correctly reports FT_ENCODING_NONE for all
      but one encoding.  Use  the new FT_WinFNT_ID_XXX values together
      with `FT_Get_WinFNT_Header' to get the WinFNT charset ID.

    - The descender metrics (face->size->metrics.descender) for WinFNT
      bitmap fonts had the wrong sign.

    - The (emulated) `seac' support for CFF fonts was broken.

    - The `flex' operator didn't work for CFF fonts.

    - PS glyphs  which  use  the   `hintmask'  operator  haven't  been
      rendered correctly in some cases.

    - Metrics for BDF and PCF bitmap font formats have been fixed.

    - Autohinting  is now  disabled for  glyphs  which  are vertically
      distorted  or mirrored  (using a  transformation matrix).   This
      fixes a bug which produced zero-height glyphs.

    - The   `freetype-config'   script   now  handles   --prefix   and
      --exec-prefix correctly; it also  returns the proper --rpath (or
      -R) value if FreeType has been built as a shared library.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Both  PCF  and BDF  drivers  now  handle  the SETWIDTH_NAME  and
      ADD_STYLE_NAME    properties.     Values    are   appended    to
      face->style_name; example: `Bold SemiCondensed'.

    - The PCF driver now handles bitmap  fonts compressed with the LZW
      algorithm (extension .pcf.Z, compressed with `compress').

    - A  new  API   function  `FT_Get_CMap_Language_ID'  (declared  in
      `tttables.h')  is  available  to   get  the  language  ID  of  a
      TrueType/SFNT cmap.

    - The hexadecimal format of  data after the `StartData' command in
      CID-keyed Type 1 fonts is now supported.  While this can't occur
      in  file-based   fonts,  it  can   happen  in  document-embedded
      resources of PostScript documents.

    - Embedded bitmaps in SFNT-based CFF fonts are now supported.

    - A simple  API is  now available  to control  FreeType's  tracing
      mechanism if compiled  with FT_DEBUG_LEVEL_TRACE.   See the file
      `ftdebug.h' for more details.

    - YAMATO Masatake contributed improved  handling of MacOS resource
      forks on non-MacOS platforms (for example, Linux can mount MacOS
      file systems).

    - Support for MacOS has been improved; there is now a new function
      `FT_New_Face_From_FSSpec'  similar to `FT_New_Face'  except that
      it accepts an FSSpec instead of a path.

    - The cache sub-system has been rewritten.

      - There is now support for deinstallation of faces.

      - A new  API function `FTC_Manager_RemoveFaceID'  has been added
        to  delete  all  `idle'  nodes  that  correspond  to  a  given
        FTC_FaceID.  All `locked' nodes  (i.e., those with a reference
        count > 0), will be modified to prevent them from appearing in
        further  lookups (they  will  be cleaned  normally when  their
        reference count reaches 0).

      - There  is  now  support  for point  scaling  (i.e.,  providing
        character sizes in points + dpis, instead of pixels).

      - Three abstract cache classes are now available:

          FTC_GCache:  Used to store  one glyph  item per  cache node,
                      with the ability to group common attributes into
                      `families'.      This    replaces     the    old
                      FTC_GlyphCache class.

          FTC_ICache: Used to store one FT_Glyph per cache node.  This
                      extends  FTC_GCache.  Family  definition, family
                      comparison, and  glyph loading are  however left
                      to sub-classes.

          FTC_SCache: Used to  store up to 16 small  bitmaps per cache
                      node.    This    extends   FTC_GCache.    Family
                      definition, family  comparison and glyph loading
                      are however left to sub-classes.

      - The file `src/cache/ftcbasic.c' implements:

          FTC_ImageCache: Extends    FTC_ICache;   implements   family
                          definitions and glyph loading similar to the
                          old API.

          FTC_SBitCache: Extends    FTC_SCache,    implements   family
                         definitions and glyph  loading similar to the
                         old API

        Client  applications  should  be  able to  extend  FTC_GCache,
        FTC_ICache, or FTC_SCache much more easily (i.e., less code to
        write, and  less callbacks).  For example,  one could envision
        caches  that are  capable of  storing  transformed (obliqued),
        stroked,   emboldened,   or   colored   glyph   images.    Use
        `ftcbasic.c' as an example.

      - All public  APIs are now  in `include/freetype/ftcache.h', (to
        be    accessed   as    `FT_CACHE_H').     The   contents    of
        `include/freetype/cache/' is only  needed by applications that
        wish to implement their own caches.

      - There were some major performance improvements through the use
        of  various programming  tricks.   Cache hits  are  up to  70%
        faster than in the old code.

      - The  FTC_CMapCache has  been simplified.  Charmaps can only be
        accessed by  index right now.  There  is also a  new API named
        `FT_Charmap_GetIndex' for this purpose.

      - The  demo programs  have been  updated to  the new  code.  The
        previous versions will not work with the current one.

      - Using  an invalid face  index in FT_Open_Face and friends  now
        causes an error even if the font contains a single face only.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Wolfgang Domröse contributed support files for building FreeType
      on the Atari using the PureC compiler.  Note that the Atari is a
      16bit platform.

    - Vitaliy Pasternak contributed project files for VS.NET 2003.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.7 and 2.1.6

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Updated  to newest  libtool  version, fixing  build problems  on
      various platforms.

    - On  Unix  platforms,  `make  install' didn't  copy  the  correct
      `ftconfig.h' file.

  Note that version 2.1.7  contains the same library  C source code as
  version 2.1.6.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.6 and 2.1.5

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The PFR  font driver didn't  load kerning tables  correctly, and
      the functions in FT_PFR_H didn't work at all.

    - Type 1 font  files in  binary format  (PFB) with  an end-of-file
      indicator weren't accepted by the FreeType engine.

    - Fonts which contain /PaintType  and /StrokeWidth no longer cause
      a segfault.  This bug has been introduced in version 2.1.5.

    - Fonts  loaded  with   FT_LOAD_RENDER  no  longer  cause  strange
      results.  This bug has been introduced in version 2.1.5.

    - Some  Windows   (bitmap)  FNT/FON  files   couldn't  be  handled
      correctly.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The internal  module API  has been heavily  changed in  favor of
      massive simplifications within the font engine.  This also means
      that authors of third-party modules must adapt their code to the
      new scheme.

      NOTE:  THE NEW SCHEME IS NOT COMPLETED YET.  PLEASE WAIT UNTIL A
      FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT!

    - The PostScript  parser has been enhanced to  handle comments and
      strings   correctly.   Additionally,   more  syntax   forms  are
      recognized.

    - Added the  optional unpatented hinting system  for TrueType.  It
      allows  typefaces which  need hinting  to produce  correct glyph
      forms (e.g., Chinese typefaces  from Dynalab) to work acceptably
      without infringing Apple patents.   This system is compiled only
      if  TT_CONFIG_OPTION_COMPILE_UNPATENTED_HINTING  is  defined  in
      ftoption.h (activated by default).


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - There  is now  a guard  in the  public header  files  to protect
      against inclusion of freetype.h from FreeType 1.

    - Direct inclusion of freetype.h  and other public header files no
      longer works.  You have to use the documented scheme

        #include <ft2build.h>
        #include FT_FREETYPE_H

      to load freetype.h with  a symbolic name.  This protects against
      renaming  of public  header  files (which  shouldn't happen  but
      actually  has, avoiding two  public header  files with  the same
      name).

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.5 and 2.1.4

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Parsing the /CIDFontName field  now removes the leading slash to
      be in sync with other font drivers.

    - gzip support was buggy.  Some fonts could not be read.

    - Fonts which  have nested subglyphs  more than one level  deep no
      longer cause a segfault.

    - Creation of synthetic  cmaps for fonts in CFF  format was broken
      partially.

    - Numeric  font  dictionary entries  for  synthetic  fonts are  no
      longer overwritten.

    - The font matrix  wasn't applied to the advance  width for Type1,
      CID, and  CFF fonts.  This caused problems  when loading certain
      synthetic Type 1 fonts like `Helvetica Narrow'.

    - The test  for the charset registry  in BDF and PCF  fonts is now
      case-insensitive.

    - FT_Vector_Rotate  sometimes  returned   strange  values  due  to
      rounding errors.

    - The  PCF  driver  now  returns  the  correct  number  of  glyphs
      (including an artificial `notdef' glyph at index 0).

    - FreeType now  supports buggy CMaps  which are contained  in many
      CJK fonts from Dynalab.

    - Opening  an invalid  font  on a  Mac  caused a  segfault due  to
      double-freeing memory.

    - BDF  fonts  with  more   than  32768  glyphs  weren't  supported
      properly.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - Accessing bitmap font formats has been synchronized.  To do that
      the FT_Bitmap_Size  structure has  been extended to  contain new
      fields `size', `x_ppem', and `y_ppem'.

    - The FNT driver now returns multiple faces, not multiple strikes.

    - The `psnames'  module has been  updated to the Adobe  Glyph List
      version 2.0.

    - The `psnames' module now understands `uXXXX[X[X]]' glyph names.

    - The algorithm for guessing the font style has been improved.

    - For fonts in SFNT format, root->height is no longer increased if
      the line gap  is zero.  There exist fonts  (containing e.g. form
      drawing  characters) which  intentionally have  a zero  line gap
      value.

    - ft_glyph_bbox_xxx  flags   are  now  deprecated   in  favour  of
      FT_GLYPH_BBOX_XXX.

    - ft_module_xxx   flags   are   now   deprecated  in   favour   of
      FT_MODULE_XXX.

    - FT_ENCODING_MS_{SJIS,GB2312,BIG5,WANSUNG,JOHAB}      are     now
      deprecated               in               favour              of
      FT_ENCODING_{SJIS,GB2312,GIB5,WANSONG,JOHAB}  -- those encodings
      are not specific to Microsoft.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The  autohinter  has been  further  improved;  for example,  `m'
      glyphs now retain its vertical symmetry.

    - Partial support of Mac fonts on non-Mac platforms.

    - `make   refdoc'   (after   first   `make')   builds   the   HTML
      documentation.  You need Python for this.

    - The make build system should  now work more reliably on DOS-like
      platforms.

    - Support for  EMX gcc  and Watson C/C++  compilers on  MS-DOS has
      been added.

    - Better VMS build support.

    - Support for the pkg-config  package by providing a `freetype.pc'
      file.

    - New configure option --with-old-mac-fonts for Darwin.

    - Some source files have been  renamed (mainly to fit into the 8.3
      naming scheme).


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.4 and 2.1.3

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Updated  to newest  libtool  version, fixing  build problems  on
      various platforms.

    - A fix  in the Gzip stream  reader: It couldn't  read certain .gz
      files properly due to a  small typo.  In certain cases, FreeType
      could  also loop  endlessly  when trying  to  load tiny  gzipped
      files.

    - The configure script now tries  to use the system-wide zlib when
      it  finds one  (instead of  the  copy found  in src/gzip).   And
      `freetype-config' has  been updated to return  relevant flags in
      this case when invoked with `--libs' (e.g. `-lzlib').

    - Certain fonts couldn't be loaded  by 2.1.3 because they lacked a
      Unicode   charmap  (e.g.   SYMBOL.TTF).    FreeType  erroneously
      rejected them.

    - The CFF loader was modified to accept fonts which only contain a
      subset of  their reference charset.  This  prevented the correct
      use of PDF-embedded fonts.

    - The logic to detect Unicode charmaps has been modified.  This is
      required to  support fonts which include both  16-bit and 32-bit
      charmaps (like very  recent asian ones) using the  new 10 and 12
      SFNT formats.

    - The TrueType  loader now limits  the depth of  composite glyphs.
      This is necessary to prevent broken fonts to break the engine by
      blowing the stack with recursive glyph definitions.

    - The CMap cache is now  capable of managing UCS-4 character codes
      that   are   mapped   through   extended  charmaps   in   recent
      TrueType/OpenType fonts.

    - The   cache  sub-system   now  properly   manages  out-of-memory
      conditions  instead of  blindly  reporting them  to the  caller.
      This means that it will try to empty the cache before restarting
      its allocations to see if that can help.

    - The  PFR driver  didn't return  the list  of  available embedded
      bitmaps properly.

    - There was  a nasty  memory leak when  using embedded  bitmaps in
      certain font formats.


  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - David Chester  contributed some enhancements  to the auto-hinter
      that  significantly increase  the  quality of  its output.   The
      Postscript hinter was also improved in several ways.

    - The FT_RENDER_MODE_LIGHT render mode was implemented.

    - A new  API function called `FT_Get_BDF_Property'  has been added
      to FT_BDF_H to  retrieve BDF properties from BDF  _and_ PCF font
      files.   THIS  IS  STILL  EXPERIMENTAL,  since  it  hasn't  been
      properly tested yet.

    - A Windows FNT specific API has been added, mostly to access font
      headers.  This is used by Wine.

    - TrueType tables  without an `hmtx' table are  now tolerated when
      an  incremental interface  is  used.  This  happens for  certain
      Type42 fonts passed from Ghostscript to FreeType.

    - The PFR font driver is  now capable of returning the font family
      and style  names when  they are available  (instead of  the sole
      `FontID').   This  is  performed  by parsing  an  *undocumented*
      portion of the font file!


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The path stroker in FT_STROKER_H has entered beta stage.  It now
      works very  well, but  its interface might  change a bit  in the
      future.  More on this in later releases.

    - The documentation for  FT_Size_Metrics didn't appear properly in
      the API reference.

    - The file docs/VERSION.DLL has been updated to explain versioning
      with FreeType  (i.e., comparing release/libtool/so  numbers, and
      how to use them in autoconf scripts).

    - The  installation  documentation  has been  seriously  revamped.
      Everything is now in the `docs' directory.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.3 and 2.1.2

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - FT_Vector_Transform  had  been  incorrectly modified  in  2.1.2,
      resulting  in  incorrect   transformations  being  applied  (for
      example, rotations were processed in opposite angles).

    - The format  8 and 12 TrueType charmap  enumeration routines have
      been fixed (FT_Get_Next_Char returned invalid values).

    - The  PFR font driver  returned incorrect  advance widths  if the
      outline  and metrics resolution  defined in  the font  file were
      different.

    - FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap now returns  successfully when called with an
      FT_BitmapGlyph argument (it previously returned an error).

    - A bug  in the Type 1  loader that prevented  valid font bounding
      boxes to be loaded from multiple master fonts.

    - The SFNT  validation code has been rewritten.   FreeType can now
      load `broken'  fonts that were  usable on Windows, but  not with
      previous versions of the library.

    - The computation of bearings in the BDF driver has been fixed.

    - The Postscript hinter crashed when trying to hint certain glyphs
      (more precisely,  when trying to  apply hints to an  empty glyph
      outline).

    - The  TrueType glyph  loader  now supports  composites in  `Apple
      format'  (they differ slightly  from Microsoft/OpenType  ones in
      the way transformation offsets are computed).

    - FreeType was  very slow at opening certain  asian CID/CFF fonts,
      due to  fixed increment  in dynamic array  re-allocations.  This
      has  been changed  to  exponential behaviour  to get  acceptable
      performance.



  II. IMPORTANT CHANGES

    - The PCF driver now supports gzip-compressed font files natively.
      This means that  you will be able to use  all these bitmap fonts
      that  come with  XFree86 with  FreeType (and  libXft/libXft2, by
      extension).

    - The  automatic and  postscript hinters  have both  been updated.
      This  results in  a relatively  important increase  of rendering
      quality since  many nasty defaults have been suppressed.  Please
      visit the web page:

        http://www.freetype.org/hinting/smooth-hinting.html

      for additional details on this topic.

    - The `load_flags' parameter of `FT_Load_Glyph' is now an FT_Int32
      (instead  of just  being  an FT_Int).   This  breaks source  and
      binary  compatibility for  16bit systems  only,  while retaining
      both of them for 32 and 64 bit ones.

      Some new flags have been added consequently:

        FT_LOAD_NO_AUTOHINT   :: Disable the use of the auto-hinter
                                 (but not native format hinters).

        FT_LOAD_TARGET_NORMAL :: Hint and render for normal
                                 anti-aliased displays.

        FT_LOAD_TARGET_MONO   :: Hint and render for 1-bit displays.

        FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD    :: Hint and render for horizontal RGB or
                                 BGR sub-pixel displays (like LCD
                                 screens).  THIS IS STILL
                                 EXPERIMENTAL!

        FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD_V  :: Same as FT_LOAD_TARGET_LCD, for
                                 vertical sub-pixel displays (like
                                 rotated LCD screens).  THIS IS STILL
                                 EXPERIMENTAL!

      FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME   is  still   supported,  but   only  affects
      rendering, not the hinting.

      Note that the `ftview'  demo program available in the `ft2demos'
      package  has been  updated to  support LCD-optimized  display on
      non-paletted displays (under Win32 and X11).

    - The  PFR  driver  now  supports embedded  bitmaps  (all  formats
      supported), and returns correct kerning metrics for all glyphs.

    - The TrueType charmap loader  now supports certain `broken' fonts
      that load under Windows without problems.

    - The cache API has been slightly modified (it's still a beta!):

       - The type  FTC_ImageDesc has been removed; it  is now replaced
         by  FTC_ImageTypeRec.   Note that  one  of  its  fields is  a
         `load_flag' parameter for FT_Load_Glyph.

       - The  field  `num_grays' of  FT_SBitRec  has  been changed  to
         `max_grays'  in  order to  fit  within  a  single byte.   Its
         maximum value is thus 255 (instead of 256 as previously).


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Added support  for the  DESTDIR variable during  `make install'.
      This simplifies packaging of FreeType.

    - Included modified  copies of the  ZLib sources in  `src/gzip' in
      order to support  gzip-compressed PCF fonts.  We do  not use the
      system-provided  zlib  for  now,   though  this  is  a  probable
      enhancement for future releases.

    - The DocMaker tool used to generate the on-line API reference has
      been   completely    rewritten.    It   is    now   located   in
      `src/tools/docmaker/docmaker.py'.  Features:

        - better cross-referenced output
        - more polished output
        - uses Python regular expressions  (though it didn't speed the
          program)
        - much  more  modular structure,  which  allows for  different
          `backends'  in  order to  generate  HTML,  XML, or  whatever
          format.

      One can regenerate the API reference by calling:

         python src/tools/docmaker/docmaker.py \
                --prefix=ft2 \
                --title=FreeType-2.1.3 \
                --output=<outputdirectory>
                include/freetype/*.h \
                include/freetype/config/*.h \
                include/freetype/cache/*.h

    - A new, experimental, support for incremental font loading (i.e.,
      loading  of fonts  where the  glyphs are  not in  the  font file
      itself, but provided by an external component, like a Postscript
      interpreter) has been added by Graham Asher.  This is still work
      in progress, however.

    - A new,  EXPERIMENTAL, path stroker  has been added.   It doesn't
      suffer  from  severe  rounding  errors  and  treat  bezier  arcs
      directly.  Still work in progress (i.e. not part of the official
      API).   See  the file  <freetype/ftstroker.h>  for  some of  the
      details.

    - The massive  re-formatting of sources and  internal re-design is
      still under-way.  Many  internal functions, constants, and types
      have been renamed.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.2 and 2.1.1

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Many  font drivers didn't  select a  Unicode charmap  by default
      when a new face  was opened (with the FT_CONFIG_OPTION_USE_CMAPS
      options enabled),  causing many applications  to not be  able to
      display text correctly with the 2.1.x releases.

    - The  PFR driver had  a bug  in its  composite loading  code that
      produces incorrectly placed accents with many fonts.

    - The Type42 driver crashed sometimes due to a nasty bug.

    - The Type 1 custom encoding  charmap didn't handle the case where
      the first glyph index wasn't 0.

    - A  serious  typo  in  the  TrueType  composite  loader  produced
      incorrectly placed  glyphs in fonts  like `Wingdings' and  a few
      others.


  II. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The Win32  Visual C++ project  file has been updated  to include
      the PFR driver as well.

    - `freetype.m4' is  now installed by default by  `make install' on
      Unix systems.

    - The function  FT_Get_PS_Font_Info now works with  CID and Type42
      fonts as well.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.1 and 2.1.0

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The  `version_info'  returned   by  `freetype-config'  in  2.1.0
      returned an invalid value.  It now returns 9:1:3 (2.0.9 returned
      9:0:3).

    - Version 2.1.0  couldn't be linked against  applications on Win32
      and  Amiga systems  due  to  a new  debug  function that  wasn't
      properly   propagated  to   the  system-specific   directory  in
      `builds'.

    - Various MacOS and Mac OS X specific fixes.

    - Fixed  a bug in  the TrueType  charmap validation  routines that
      made version  2.1.0 too restrictive  -- many popular  fonts have
      been rejected.

    - There was  still a very small difference  between the monochrome
      glyph bitmaps produced by FreeType 1.x and FreeType 2.x with the
      bytecode  interpreter enabled.   This was  caused by  an invalid
      flag setting in the TrueType glyph loader, making the rasterizer
      change  its  drop-out   control  mode.   Now  the results should
      _really_ be completely identical.

    - The TrueType name table loader has been improved to support many
      popular  though buggy Asian  fonts.  It  now ignores  empty name
      entries,  invalid  pointer offsets  and  a  few other  incorrect
      subtleties.  Moreover,  name strings  are now loaded  on demand,
      which reduces the memory load  of many faces (e.g. the ARIAL.TTF
      font file contains a 10kByte name table with 70 names).

    - Fixed a bug in the Postscript hinter that prevented family blues
      substitution to happen correctly.


  II. NEW FEATURES

    - Three new font drivers in this release:

      * A  BDF  font driver,  contributed  by  Franco Zappa  Nardelli,
        heavily  modified   by  Werner  Lemberg.    It  also  supports
        anti-aliased bitmaps (using a slightly extended BDF format).

      * A Type42  font driver, contributed by Roberto  Alameda.  It is
        still experimental but seems to work relatively well.

      * A PFR  font driver, contributed  by David Turner  himself.  It
        doesn't  support PFR  hinting --  note that  BitStream  has at
        least two patents on this format!


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The  cache  sub-system has  been  optimized  in important  ways.
      Cache hits are now significantly faster.  For example, using the
      CMap cache is about  twice faster than calling FT_Get_Char_Index
      on most platforms.  Similarly, using an SBit cache is about five
      times faster  than loading the  bitmaps from a bitmap  file, and
      300 to  500 times  faster than generating  them from  a scalable
      format.

      Note that  you should recompile  your sources if you  designed a
      custom  cache  class for  the  FT2  Cache  subsystem, since  the
      changes performed are source, but not binary, compatible.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.1.0 and 2.0.9

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - The  TrueType bytecode  interpreter  has been  fixed to  produce
      _exactly_ the same output as FreeType 1.x.  Previous differences
      were due  to slightly distinct  fixed-point computation routines
      used to perform dot products and vector length measurements.

      It seems  that native TrueType hinting  is _extremely_ sensitive
      to  rounding errors.  The  required vector  computation routines
      have been optimized and placed within the `ttinterp.c' file.

    - Fixed the parsing of accelerator tables in the PCF font driver.

    - Fixed the Type1 glyph loader  routine used to compute the font's
      maximum advance width.


  II. NEW FEATURES

    - The `configure' script used on Unix systems has been modified to
      check  that  GNU  Make  is  being used  to  build  the  library.
      Otherwise,  it  will display  a  message  proposing  to use  the
      GNUMAKE environment variable to name it.

      The Unix-specific file README.UNX has been modified accordingly.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The  FreeType  License in  `docs/FTL.TXT'  has  been updated  to
      include  a  proposed preferred  disclaimer.   If  you are  using
      FreeType in your products, you are encouraged (but not mandated)
      to use the following text in your documentation:

      """
        Portions of this software are copyright © 1996-2002 The
        FreeType Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
      """

    - The default size of the render pool has been reduced to 16kByte.
      This  shouldn't result  in any  noticeable  performance penalty,
      unless you are  using the engine as-is to  render very large and
      complex glyphs.

    - The  FreeType 2  redesign has  begun.  More  information  can be
      found at this URL:

        http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/redesign.html

      The following  internal changes  have been performed  within the
      sources of this release:

        - Many   internal  types   have  been   renamed   to  increase
          consistency.   The  following  should  be true,  except  for
          public types:

            * All structure  types have a name ending  in `Rec' (short
              for `record').

            * A  pointer-to-structure type  has the  same name  as the
              structure, _without_ the `Rec' suffix.

              Example:

                typedef struct FooRec_
                {
                  ...

                } FooRec, *Foo;

        - Many   internal  macros  have   been  renamed   to  increase
          consistency.  The following should be true:

            * All  macros  have a  name  beginning  with `FT_'.   This
              required a few changes like

                ALLOC   => FT_ALLOC
                FREE    => FT_FREE
                REALLOC => FT_REALLOC

            * All  macros are completely  UPPERCASE.  This  required a
              few changes like:

                READ_Short  => FT_READ_SHORT
                NEXT_Short  => FT_NEXT_SHORT
                GET_ULongLE => FT_GET_ULONG_LE
                MEM_Set     => FT_MEM_SET
                MEM_Copy    => FT_MEM_COPY
                etc.

            * Whenever   possible,   all   macro  names   follow   the
              FT_<OBJECT>_<METHOD> pattern.  For example

                ACCESS_Frame   => FT_FRAME_ENTER
                FORGET_Frame   => FT_FRAME_EXIT
                EXTRACT_Frame  => FT_FRAME_EXTRACT
                RELEASE_Frame  => FT_FRAME_RELEASE

                FILE_Pos       => FT_STREAM_POS
                FILE_Seek      => FT_STREAM_SEEK
                FILE_Read      => FT_STREAM_READ
                FILE_ReadAt    => FT_STREAM_READ_AT
                READ_Fields    => FT_STREAM_READ_FIELDS

        - Many  internal functions  have  been renamed  to follow  the
          FT_<Object>_<Method> pattern.  For example:

            FT_Seek_Stream       => FT_Stream_Seek
            FT_Read_Stream_At    => FT_Stream_ReadAt
            FT_Done_Stream       => FT_Stream_Close
            FT_New_Stream        => FT_Stream_Open
            FT_New_Memory_Stream => FT_Stream_OpenMemory
            FT_Extract_Frame     => FT_Stream_ExtractFrame

          Note that method names do not contain `_'.

        - The FT_ALLOC_ARRAY  and FT_REALLOC_ARRAY have  been replaced
          with  FT_NEW_ARRAY and  FT_RENEW_ARRAY which  do not  take a
          type  as the  fourth argument.   Instead, the  array element
          type  size is computed  automatically from  the type  of the
          target pointer used.

        - A  new object  class, FT_CMap,  has been  introduced.  These
          internal  objects are  used to  model character  maps.  This
          eases  the support  of additional  charmap types  within the
          engine.

        - A new  configuration file named `ftstdlib.h'  has been added
          to `include/freetype/config'.  It  is used to define aliases
          for  _every_ routine  of the  ISO  C library  that the  font
          engine   uses.    Each    aliases   has   a   `ft_'   prefix
          (e.g. `ft_strlen' is an alias for `strlen').

          This is  used to  ease the porting  of FreeType 2  to exotic
          runtime environments where the ISO C Library isn't available
          (e.g.  XFree86 extension modules).

      More details are available in the `ChangeLog' file.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.9 and 2.0.8

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Certain fonts like `foxjump.ttf' contain broken name tables with
      invalid entries and wild offsets.  This caused FreeType to crash
      when trying to load them.

      The  SFNT `name'  table  loader has  been  fixed to  be able  to
      support these strange fonts.

      Moreover, the code  in charge of processing this  table has been
      changed  to always favour  Windows-formatted entries  over other
      ones.  Hence,  a font that works  on Windows but not  on the Mac
      will  load cleanly in  FreeType and  report accurate  values for
      Family & PostScript names.

    - The CID font driver has been fixed.  It unfortunately returned a
      Postscript   Font   name   with   a   leading   slash,   as   in
      `/MunhwaGothic-Regular'.

    - FreeType  2 should now  compile fine  on AIX  4.3.3 as  a shared
      library.

    - A  bug  in the  Postscript  hinter  has  been found  and  fixed,
      removing un-even stem widths at small pixel sizes (like 14-17).

      This  improves the  quality of  a certain  number  of Postscript
      fonts.


  II. NEW FEATURES

    - A  new function  named  `FT_Library_Version' has  been added  to
      return  the current  library's major,  minor, and  patch version
      numbers.   This is  important since  the  macros FREETYPE_MAJOR,
      FREETYPE_MINOR,  and  FREETYPE_PATCH  cannot  be used  when  the
      library is dynamically linked by a program.

    - Two   new  APIs   have  been   added:   `FT_Get_First_Char'  and
      `FT_Get_Next_Char'.

      Together,  these can  be used  to iterate  efficiently  over the
      currently  selected  charmap of  a  given  face.   Read the  API
      reference for more details.


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - The FreeType sources are  under heavy internal re-factoring.  As
      a consequence,  we have created  a branch named `STABLE'  on the
      CVS to hold all future releases/fixes in the 2.0.x family.

      The  HEAD  branch  now  contains  the  re-factored  sources  and
      shouldn't  be used for  testing or  packaging new  releases.  In
      case you  would like  to access the  2.0.9 sources from  our CVS
      repository, use the tag `VER-2-0-9'.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.8 and 2.0.7

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - There was  a small but  nasty bug in  `freetype-config.in' which
      caused the `freetype-config' script to fail on Unix.

      This didn't prevent the installation  of the library or even its
      execution, but caused problems  when trying to compile many Unix
      packages that depend on it.

    - Some TrueType or OpenType fonts embedded in PDF documents do not
      have  a  'cmap',  'post'  and  'name'  as  is  required  by  the
      specification.  FreeType no longer refuses to load such fonts.

    - Various fixes to the PCF font driver.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.7 and 2.0.6

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - Fixed  two  bugs in  the  Type 1  font  driver.   The first  one
      resulted in a memory leak in subtle cases.  The other one caused
      FreeType to crash when  trying to load `.gsf' files (Ghostscript
      so-called Postscript fonts).

      (This  made _many_  KDE applications  crash on  certain systems.
       FreeType _is_ becoming a critical system component on Linux :-)

    - Fixed a memory leak in the CFF font driver.

    - Fixed a memory leak in the PCF font driver.

    - Fixed       the        Visual       C++       project       file
      `builds/win32/visualc/freetype.dsp' since  it didn't include the
      Postscript hinter component, causing errors at build time.

    - Fixed a  small rendering bug  in the anti-aliased  renderer that
      only  occurred when  trying to  draw  thin (less  than 1  pixel)
      strokes.

    - Fixed  `builds/unix/freetype2.a4' which  is used  to  generate a
      valid `freetype2.m4' for use with autoconf.

    - Fixed the OpenVMS Makefiles.


  II. MISCELLANEOUS

    - Added  `configure'  and   `install'  scripts  to  the  top-level
      directory.  A GNU-style installation is thus now easily possible
      with

        ./configure  <options>
        make
        make install


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.6 and 2.0.5

  I. IMPORTANT BUG FIXES

    - It wasn't possible to load embedded bitmaps when the auto-hinter
      was used.  This is now fixed.

    - The TrueType  font driver  didn't load some  composites properly
      (the  sub-glyphs  were  slightly  shifted,  and  this  was  only
      noticeable when using monochrome rendering).

    - Various  fixes  to the  auto-hinter.   They  merely improve  the
      output of sans-serif fonts.   Note that there are still problems
      with serifed fonts and composites (accented characters).

    - All scalable  font drivers erroneously  returned un-fitted glyph
      advances when hinting was  requested.  This created problems for
      a number  of layout applications.  This  is a very  old bug that
      got  undetected mainly  because most  test/demo  program perform
      rounding explicitly or implicitly (through the cache).

    - `FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap' did erroneously  modify the source glyph in
      certain cases.

    - `glnames.py'  still contained  a bug  that made  FreeType return
      invalid names for certain glyphs.

    - The  library crashed  when  loading certain  Type  1 fonts  like
      `sadn.pfb'  (`Stalingrad  Normal'),   which  appear  to  contain
      pathetic font info dictionaries.

    - The TrueType glyph  loader is now much more  paranoid and checks
      everything when loading a given glyph image.  This was necessary
      to avoid problems (crashes and/or memory overwrites) with broken
      fonts that came from a really buggy automatic font converter.


  II. IMPORTANT UPDATES AND NEW FEATURES

    - Important updates to the Mac-specific parts of the library.

    - The caching sub-system has  been completely re-designed, and its
      API has  evolved (the  old one is  still supported  for backward
      compatibility).

      The documentation for it is  not yet completed, sorry.  For now,
      you are encouraged to continue  using the old API.  However, the
      ftview  demo program in  the ft2demos  package has  already been
      updated to use the new caching functions.

    - A new charmap cache is provided too.  See `FTC_CMapCache'.  This
      is useful to perform  character code -> glyph index translations
      quickly, without the need for an opened FT_Face.

    - A NEW POSTSCRIPT HINTER module  has been added to support native
      hints in  the following  formats: PostScript Type  1, PostScript
      CID, and CFF/CEF.

      Please test!  Note that  the auto-hinter produces better results
      for a number of  badly-hinted fonts (mostly auto-generated ones)
      though.

    - A memory debugger is now  part of the standard FreeType sources.
      To      enable      it,      define      FT_DEBUG_MEMORY      in
      <freetype/config/ftoption.h>, and recompile the library.

      Additionally, define  the _environment_ variable FT_DEBUG_MEMORY
      and run any program using FreeType.  When the library is exited,
      a  summary  of memory  footprints  and  possible  leaks will  be
      displayed.

      This works transparently with  _any_ program that uses FreeType.
      However, you  will need a lot  of memory to  use this (allocated
      blocks are never  released to the heap to  detect double deletes
      easily).


  III. MISCELLANEOUS

    - We  are  aware  of  subtle  differences between  the  output  of
      FreeType  versions   1  and  2  when  it   comes  to  monochrome
      TrueType-hinted glyphs.   These are  most probably due  to small
      differences in the monochrome rasterizers and will be worked out
      in an upcoming release.

    - We have decided to fork the sources in a `stable' branch, and an
      `unstable' one, since FreeType  is becoming a critical component
      of many Unix systems.

      The next  bug-fix releases of  the library will be  named 2.0.7,
      2.0.8, etc.,  while the `2.1'  branch will contain a  version of
      the sources where we will start major reworking of the library's
      internals, in order to produce FreeType 2.2.0 (or even 3.0) in a
      more distant future.

      We  also hope  that this  scheme will  allow much  more frequent
      releases than in the past.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.5 and 2.0.4

  NOTE THAT 2.0.5 DOES NOT CONTAIN THE POSTSCRIPT HINTER.  THIS MODULE
  WILL BE PART OF THE NEXT RELEASE (EITHER 2.0.6 or 2.1)

  - Fixed a bug that made  certain glyphs, like `Cacute', `cacute' and
    `lslash'  unavailable from Unicode  charmaps of  Postscript fonts.
    This prevented the correct display of Polish text, for example.

  - The kerning table of Type 1 fonts was loaded by FreeType, when its
    AFM    file    was    attached    to    its    face,    but    the
    FT_FACE_FLAG_HAS_KERNING   bit  flags   was  not   set  correctly,
    preventing FT_Get_Kerning to return meaningful values.

  - Improved  SFNT (TrueType  & OpenType)  charmap  support.  Slightly
    better performance, as well as support for the new formats defined
    by the OpenType 1.3 specification (8, 10, and 12)

  - Fixed a  serious typo in `src/base/ftcalc.c'  which caused invalid
    computations in certain rare cases, producing ugly artefacts.

  - The  size  of the  EM  square is  computed  with  a more  accurate
    algorithm for Postscript fonts.   The old one caused slight errors
    with embedded fonts found in PDF documents.

  - Fixed  a  bug in  the  cache  manager  that prevented  normal  LRU
    behaviour  within the cache  manager, causing  unnecessary reloads
    (for FT_Face and FT_Size objects only).

  - Added  a new  function named  `FT_Get_Name_Index' to  retrieve the
    glyph index of a given glyph name, when found in a face.

  - Added  a new function  named `FT_Get_Postscript_Name'  to retrieve
    the `unique' Postscript font name of a given face.

  - Added   a   new   public   header  size   named   FT_SIZES_H   (or
    <freetype/ftsizes.h>) providing  new FT_Size-management functions:
    FT_New_Size, FT_Activate_Size, FT_Done_Size.

  - Fixed a  reallocation bug that  generated a dangling  pointer (and
    possibly    memory    leaks)    with    Postscript    fonts    (in
    src/psaux/psobjs.c).

  - Many fixes for 16-bit correctness.

  - Removed many pedantic compiler warnings from the sources.

  - Added an Amiga build directory in `builds/amiga'.


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.4 and 2.0.3

  - Fixed a rather annoying bug that was introduced in 2.0.3.  Namely,
    the font  transformation set through  FT_Set_Transform was applied
    twice to auto-hinted glyphs, resulting in incorrectly rotated text
    output.

  - Fixed _many_  compiler warnings.   FT2 should now  compile cleanly
    with Visual  C++'s most pedantic warning level  (/W4).  It already
    compiled fine with GCC and a few other compilers.

  - Fixed a bug  that prevented the linear advance  width of composite
    TrueType glyphs to be correctly returned.

  - Fixed    the    Visual    C++    project    files    located    in
    `builds/win32/visualc' (previous versions  used older names of the
    library).

  - Many  32-bit constants  have an  `L' appended  to their  value, in
    order to improve the 16-bitness  of the code.  Someone is actually
    trying to use FT2 on an Atari ST machine!

  - Updated  the  `builds/detect.mk' file  in  order to  automatically
    build FT2  on AIX systems.   AIX uses `/usr/sbin/init'  instead of
    `/sbin/init' and wasn't previously  detected as a Unix platform by
    the FreeType build system.

  - Updated  the  Unix-specific  portions  of the  build  system  (new
    libtool version, etc.).

  - The  SFNT kerning  loader now  ensures  that the  table is  sorted
    (since some problem fonts do not meet this requirement).


=======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.3 and 2.0.2

  I. CHANGES TO THE MODULES / FONT DRIVERS

    - THE  AUTO-HINTER HAS  BEEN SLIGHTLY  IMPROVED, in  order  to fix
      several annoying artefacts, mainly:

        - Blue  zone alignment  of  horizontal stems  wasn't performed
          correctly, resulting in artefacts  like the `d' being placed
          one pixel below the `b' in some fonts like Time New Roman.

        - Overshoot thresholding  wasn't performed correctly, creating
          unpleasant artefacts at large character pixel sizes.

        - Composite glyph loading has  been simplified.  This gets rid
          of  various artefacts  where the  components of  a composite
          glyphs were not correctly spaced.

      These are  the last changes to the  current auto-hinting module.
      A new  hinting sub-system is currently  in the work  in order to
      support native hints  in Type 1 / CFF /  OpenType fonts, as well
      as globally improve rendering.

    - The  PCF  driver has  been  fixed.   It  reported invalid  glyph
      dimensions for the fonts available on Solaris.

    - The Type  1, CID and CFF  drivers have been modified  to fix the
      computation of the EM size.

    - The Type 1  driver has been fixed to avoid  a dangerous bug that
      crashed the library with non-conforming fonts (i.e. ones that do
      not place the .notdef glyph at position 0).

    - The TrueType  driver had a  rather subtle bug  (dangling pointer
      when loading  composite glyphs) that could crash  the library in
      rare occasions!


  II. HIGH-LEVEL API CHANGES

    - The error  code enumeration values have been  changed.  An error
      value  is decomposed  in  a  generic error  code,  and a  module
      number.  see <freetype/fterrors.h> for details.

    - A   new  public   header   file  has   been  introduced,   named
      FT_TRIGONOMETRY_H     (include/freetype/fttrig.h),     providing
      trigonometric functions to  compute sines, cosines, arctangents,
      etc. with 16.16 fixed precision.  The implementation is based on
      the CORDIC  algorithm and is very fast  while being sufficiently
      accurate.


  III. INTERNALS

    - Added  BeOS-specific files  in the  old build  sub-system.  Note
      that no changes were required to compile the library with Jam.

    - The  configuration  is now  capable  of automatically  detecting
      64-bit integers  on a set  of predefined compilers  (GCC, Visual
      C++, Borland C++) and will use them by default.  This provides a
      small performance boost.

    - A  small memory leak  that happened  when opening  0-sized files
      (duh!)  have been fixed.

    - Fixed bezier  stack depth  bug in the  routines provided  by the
      FT_BBOX_H  header   file.   Also  fixed  similar   bugs  in  the
      rasterizers.

    - The outline bounding  box code has been rewritten  to use direct
      computations,  instead of  bezier sub-division,  to  compute the
      exact bounding box of glyphs.   This is slightly slower but more
      accurate.

    - The build system has been  improved and fixed, mainly to support
      `make'  on Windows  2000  correctly, avoid  problems with  `make
      distclean' on non Unix systems, etc.

    - Hexadecimal  constants  have been  suffixed  with  `U' to  avoid
      problems with certain compilers on 64-bit platforms.

    - A new directory named `src/tools' has been created.  It contains
      Python scripts and simple unit test programs used to develop the
      library.

    - The DocMaker tool has been  moved from `docs' to `src/tools' and
      has been updated with the following:

         - Now accepts the `--title=XXXX' or `-t XXXX' option from the
           command line to set the project's name in the generated API
           reference.

         - Now accepts the `--output=DIR'  or `-o DIR' option from the
           command line to set  the output directory for all generated
           HTML files.

         - Now accepts the `--prefix=XXXX' or `-p XXX' option from the
           command  line  to  set  the  file prefix  to  use  for  all
           generated HTML files.

         - Now generates the current  time/data on each generated page
           in order to distinguish between versions.

      DocMaker  can be  used with  other  projects now,  not only  FT2
      (e.g. MLib, FTLayout, etc.).


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.2 and 2.0.1

  I. CHANGES TO THE MODULES / FONT DRIVERS

    - THE TRUETYPE BYTECODE INTERPRETER IS NOW TURNED OFF, in order to
      avoid legal problems  with the Apple patents.  It  seems that we
      mistakenly  turned this option  on in  previous releases  of the
      build.

      Note that if  you want to use the  bytecode interpreter in order
      to get high-quality TrueType  rendering, you will need to toggle
      by        hand        the        definition        of        the
      TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER   macro    in   the   file
      `include/freetype/config/ftoption.h'.

    - The CFF driver has been improved by Tom Kacvinsky and Sander van
      der Wal:

      * Support for `seac' emulation.
      * Support for `dotsection'.
      * Support for retrieving glyph names through
        `FT_Get_Glyph_Name'.

      The first two items are necessary to correctly a large number of
      Type 1 fonts converted to the CFF formats by Adobe Acrobat.

    - The Type 1 driver was also improved by Tom & others:

      * Better EM size computation.
      * Better support for synthetic (transformed) fonts.
      * The  Type 1  driver returns  the charstrings  corresponding to
        each glyph in the  `glyph->control_data' field after a call to
        `FT_Load_Glyph' (thanks Ha Shao).

    - Various other bugfixes, including the following:

      * Fixed a nasty memory leak in the Type 1 driver.
      * The autohinter  and the pcf  driver used static  writable data
        when they shouldn't.
      * Many casts were added to  make the code more 64-bits safe.  It
        also now compiles on Windows XP 64-bits without warnings.
      * Some incorrect writable statics were removed in the `autohint'
        and `pcf' drivers.  FreeType 2 now compiles on Epoc again.


  II. CHANGES TO THE HIGH-LEVEL API

    - The library header files inclusion scheme has been changed.  The
      old scheme looked like:

        #include <freetype/freetype.h>
        #include <freetype/ftglyph.h>
        #include <freetype/ftcache.h>
        #include <freetype/cache/ftimage.h>

      Now you should use:

        #include <ft2build.h>
        #include FT_FREETYPE_H
        #include FT_GLYPH_H
        #include FT_CACHE_H
        #include FT_CACHE_IMAGE_H

      NOTE THAT  THE OLD  INCLUSION SCHEME WILL  STILL WORK  WITH THIS
      RELEASE.  HOWEVER, WE  DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THIS  WILL STILL BE
      TRUE IN THE NEXT ONE (A.K.A. FREETYPE 2.1).

      The  file <ft2build.h>  is used  to define  the  header filename
      macros.  The complete and  commented list of macros is available
      in the API reference under the section name `Header File Macros'
      in Chapter I.

      For more information, see section I of the following document:

        http://www.freetype.org/
          freetype2/docs/tutorial/step1.html

      or

        http://freetype.sourceforge.net/
          freetype2/docs/tutorial/step1.html

    - Many, many comments have been added to the public source file in
      order to  automatically generate  the API Reference  through the
      `docmaker.py' Python script.

      The latter has been updated  to support the grouping of sections
      in chapters and better index sort.  See:

        http://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-toc.html


  III. CHANGES TO THE BUILD PROCESS

    - If you  are not  building FreeType 2  with its own  build system
      (but with your own Makefiles or project files), you will need to
      be  aware that  the  build  process has  changed  a little  bit.

      You don't  need to put the  `src' directory in  the include path
      when  compiling  any FT2  component.   Instead,  simply put  the
      component's directory in the current include path.

      So, if you were doing something like:

        cc -c -Iinclude -Isrc src/base/ftbase.c

      change the line to:

        cc -c -Iinclude -Isrc/base src/base/ftbase.c

      If you were doing something like:

        cd src/base
        cc -c -I../../include -I.. ftbase.c

      change it to:

        cd src/base
        cc -c -I../../include ftbase.c


======================================================================

CHANGES BETWEEN 2.0.1 and 2.0

  2.0.1 introduces a few changes:

    - Fixed many bugs related to  the support of CFF / OpenType fonts.
      These  formats are  now much  better supported  though  there is
      still work planned to  deal with charset tables and PDF-embedded
      CFF files that use the old `seac' command.

    - The  library could not  be compiled  in debug  mode with  a very
      small  number   of  C  compilers   whose  pre-processors  didn't
      implement the `##'  directive correctly (i.e. per se  the ANSI C
      specification!)  An elegant fix was found.

    - Added  support for  the  free Borland  command-line C++  Builder
      compiler.   Use `make  setup bcc32'.   Also fixed  a  few source
      lines that generated new warnings with BCC32.

    - Fixed a bug in FT_Outline_Get_BBox when computing the extrema of
      a conic Bezier arc.

    - Updated the INSTALL file to add IDE compilation.

    - Other  minor bug  fixes,  from  invalid Type  1  style flags  to
      correct   support   of  synthetic   (obliqued)   fonts  in   the
      auto-hinter, better support for embedded bitmaps in a SFNT font.

    - Fixed some problems with `freetype-config'.

  Finally, the `standard' scheme for including FreeType headers is now
  gradually changing,  but this will  be explained in a  later release
  (probably 2.0.2).

  And very  special thanks to Tom Kacvinsky  and YAMANO-UCHI Hidetoshi
  for their contributions!

CHANGES BETWEEN beta8 and 2.0

  - Changed  the default  installation  path for  public headers  from
    `include/freetype' to `include/freetype2'.

    Also added a new `freetype-config' that is automatically generated
    and installed  on Unix and  Cygwin systems.  The script  itself is
    used to retrieve the current  install path, C compilation flags as
    well as linker flags.

  - Fixed several small bugs:

    * Incorrect max advance width for fixed-pitch Type 1 fonts.
    * Incorrect glyph names for certain TrueType fonts.
    * The  glyph advance  was not  copied when  FT_Glyph_To_Bitmap was
      called.
    * The  linearHoriAdvance  and  linearVertAdvance  fields  were not
      correctly returned for glyphs processed by the auto-hinter.
    * `type1z'  renamed back to  `type1'; the  old `type1'  module has
      been removed.

  - Revamped the  build system  to make it  a lot more  generic.  This
    will  allow us  to  re-use  nearly un-modified  in  lots of  other
    projects (including FreeType Layout).

  - Changed `cid' to use `psaux' too.

  - Added the  cache sub-system.  See <freetype/ftcache.h>  as well as
    the sources  in `src/cache'.  Note  that it compiles but  is still
    untested for now.

  - Updated `docs/docmaker.py', a draft  API reference is available at
    http://www.freetype.org/ft2api.html.

  - Changed `type1' to use `psaux'.

  - Created a  new module named  `psaux' to hold  the Type 1 &  Type 2
    parsing routines.  It should be  used by `type1', `cid', and `cff'
    in the future.

  - Fixed an important bug in `FT_Glyph_Get_CBox'.

  - Fixed  some compiler  warnings  that happened  since the  TrueType
    bytecode decoder was deactivated by default.

  - Fixed two memory leaks:

    * The    memory   manager   (16    bytes)   isn't    released   in
      FT_Done_FreeType!
    * Using custom input streams, the  copy of the original stream was
      never released.

  - Fixed the  auto-hinter by performing automatic  computation of the
    `filling direction' of each glyph.   This is done through a simple
    and  fast approximation, and  seems to  work (problems  spotted by
    Werner though).  The Arphic fonts are a lot nicer though there are
    still a lot of things to do to handle Asian fonts correctly.


======================================================================

BETA-8 (RELEASE CANDIDATE) CHANGES

  - Deactivated the TrueType bytecode interpreter by default.

  - Deactivated the `src/type1' font driver.  Now `src/type1z' is used
    by default.

  - Updates to the build system.  We now compile the library correctly
    under  Unix  system  through  `configure' which  is  automatically
    called on the first `make' invocation.

  - Added the auto-hinting module!  Fixing some bugs here and there.

  - Found some bugs in the  composite loader (seac) of the Type1-based
    font drivers.

  - Renamed the directory `freetype2/config' to `freetype2/builds' and
    updated all relevant files.

  - Found a memory leak in the `type1' driver.

  - Incorporated Tom's patches to  support flex operators correctly in
    OpenType/CFF fonts.  Now all I need is to support pure CFF and CEF
    fonts to be done with this driver :-)

  - Added the  Windows FNT/FON driver in `src/winfonts'.   For now, it
    always  `simulates'   a  Unicode  charmap,  so   it  shouldn't  be
    considered completed right now.

    It  is there  to be  more a  proof of  concept than  anything else
    anyway.  The driver is a single  C source file, that compiles to 3
    Kb of code.

    I'm  still working on  the PCF/BDF  drivers, but  I'm too  lazy to
    finish them now.

  - CHANGES TO THE HIGH-LEVEL API

    * FT_Get_Kerning has a new parameter that allows you to select the
      coordinates of the kerning  vector (font units, scaled, scaled +
      grid-fitted).
    * The  outline functions are  now in <freetype/ftoutln.h>  and not
      part of <freetype/freetype.h> anymore.
    * <freetype/ftmodule.h>    now     contains    declarations    for
       FT_New_Library, FT_Done_Library, FT_Add_Default_Modules.
    * The so-called convenience  functions have moved from `ftoutln.c'
      to  `ftglyph.c',  and  are  thus available  with  this  optional
      component    of   the   library.     They   are    declared   in
      <freetype/ftglyph.h> now.
    * Anti-aliased  rendering is now  the default  for FT_Render_Glyph
      (i.e. corresponds to render_mode == 0 == ft_render_mode_normal).
      To generate a monochrome bitmap, use ft_render_mode_mono, or the
      FT_LOAD_MONOCHROME     flag    in    FT_Load_Glyph/FT_Load_Char.
      FT_LOAD_ANTI_ALIAS is still defined, but values to 0.
    * <freetype/freetype.h>  now include <freetype/config/ftconfig.h>,
      solving a few headaches :-)
    * The type FT_GlyphSlotRec has now a `library' field.

  - CHANGES TO THE `ftglyph.h' API

    This API has  been severely modified in order  to make it simpler,
    clearer, and more  efficient.  It certainly now looks  like a real
    `glyph factory'  object, and allows client  applications to manage
    (i.e.  transform,  bbox  and  render) glyph  images  without  ever
    knowing their original format.

  - Added  support  for CID-keyed  fonts  to  the  CFF driver.   Maybe
    support for pure CFF + CEF fonts should come in?

  - Cleaned up  source code in order  to avoid two  functions with the
    same name.  Also  changed the names of the  files in `type1z' from
    `t1XXXX' to `z1XXXX' in order to avoid any conflicts.

    `make multi' now works well :-)

    Also removed the use of `cidafm' for now, even if the source files
    are  still there.  This  functionality will  certainly  go into  a
    specific module.

  - ADDED SUPPORT FOR THE AUTO-HINTER

    It  works :-) I  have a  demo program  which simply  is a  copy of
    `ftview'       that      does       a      `FT_Add_Module(library,
    &autohinter_module_class)' after  library initialization, and Type
    1 & OpenType/CFF fonts are now hinted.

    CID  fonts are  not hinted,  as they  include no  charmap  and the
    auto-hinter doesn't include  `generic' global metrics computations
    yet.

    Now, I need to release this thing to the FreeType 2 source.

  - CHANGES TO THE RENDERER MODULES

    The  monochrome  and smooth  renderers  are  now  in two  distinct
    directories, namely `src/raster1' and `src/smooth'.  Note that the
    old `src/renderer' is now gone.

    I ditched  the 5-gray-levels renderers.  Basically,  it involved a
    simple #define toggle in 'src/raster1/ftraster.c'.

    FT_Render_Glyph,  FT_Outline_Render  &  FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap  now
    select the best renderer  available, depending on render mode.  If
    the current renderer for a  given glyph image format isn't capable
    of supporting  the render mode, another  one will be  found in the
    library's list.   This means that client applications  do not need
    to  switch or  set  the  renderers themselves  (as  in the  latest
    change), they'll get what they want automatically.  At last.

    Changed the demo programs accordingly.

  - MAJOR INTERNAL REDESIGN:

    A lot of internal modifications  have been performed lately on the
    source in order to provide the following enhancements:

    * More generic module support:

      The FT_Module  type is  now defined to  represent a handle  to a
      given  module.   The  file  <freetype/ftmodule.h>  contains  the
      FT_Module_Class definition, as well as the module-loading public
      API.

      The  FT_Driver type  is still  defined, and  still  represents a
      pointer to  a font driver.  Note that  FT_Add_Driver is replaced
      by FT_Add_Module, FT_Get_Driver by FT_Get_Module, etc.

    * Support for generic glyph image types:

      The FT_Renderer  type is a pointer  to a module  used to perform
      various operations on glyph image.

      Each renderer is  capable of handling images in  a single format
      (e.g. ft_glyph_format_outline).  Its functions are used to:

      - transform an glyph image
      - render a glyph image into a bitmap
      - return the control box (dimensions) of a given glyph image

      The scan converters `ftraster.c' and `ftgrays.c' have been moved
      to the new directory `src/renderer', and are used to provide two
      default renderer modules.

      One corresponds  to the `standard' scan-converter,  the other to
      the `smooth' one.

      he  current  renderer  can  be  set  through  the  new  function
      FT_Set_Renderer.

      The old raster-related function FT_Set_Raster, FT_Get_Raster and
      FT_Set_Raster_Mode have now disappeared, in favor of the new:

        FT_Get_Renderer
        FT_Set_Renderer

      See the file <freetype/ftrender.h> for more details.

      These  changes  were  necessary  to properly  support  different
      scalable formats in the future, like bi-color glyphs, etc.

    * Glyph loader object:

      A  new  internal  object,  called  a  'glyph  loader'  has  been
      introduced in the base layer.  It is used by all scalable format
      font drivers to load glyphs and composites.

      This object  has been  created to reduce  the code size  of each
      driver,  as  each  one  of  them  basically  re-implemented  its
      functionality.

      See <freetype/internal/ftobjs.h> and the FT_GlyphLoader type for
      more information.

    * FT_GlyphSlot has new fields:

      In  order   to  support  extended  features   (see  below),  the
      FT_GlyphSlot structure has a few new fields:

      linearHoriAdvance:

        This  field  gives  the   linearly  scaled  (i.e.  scaled  but
        unhinted) advance  width for the  glyph, expressed as  a 16.16
        fixed pixel value.  This is useful to perform WYSIWYG text.

      linearVertAdvance:
        This field  gives the linearly  scaled advance height  for the
        glyph  (relevant in  vertical  glyph layouts  only).  This  is
        useful to perform WYSIWYG text.

        Note that  the two above field replace  the removed `metrics2'
        field in the glyph slot.

      advance:
        This field is a vector  that gives the transformed advance for
        the glyph.   By default, it corresponds to  the advance width,
        unless  FT_LOAD_VERTICAL_LAYOUT  was  specified  when  calling
        FT_Load_Glyph or FT_Load_Char.

      bitmap_left:
        This  field gives  the  distance in  integer  pixels from  the
        current pen position  to the left-most pixel of  a glyph image
        IF IT IS  A BITMAP.  It is only valid  when the `format' field
        is set to `ft_glyph_format_bitmap', for example, after calling
        the new function FT_Render_Glyph.

      bitmap_top:
        This  field gives  the  distance in  integer  pixels from  the
        current pen position (located on the baseline) to the top-most
        pixel of the  glyph image IF IT IS  A BITMAP.  Positive values
        correspond to upwards Y.

      loader:
        This  is a  new  private  field for  the  glyph slot.   Client
        applications should not touch it.


    * Support for transforms and direct rendering in FT_Load_Glyph:

      Most of the functionality found in <freetype/ftglyph.h> has been
      moved to the core library.  Hence, the following:

      - A   transform   can   be   specified  for   a   face   through
        FT_Set_Transform.  this transform  is applied by FT_Load_Glyph
        to  scalable glyph  images (i.e.  NOT TO  BITMAPS)  before the
        function returns, unless the bit flag FT_LOAD_IGNORE_TRANSFORM
        was set in the load flags.

      - Once  a  glyph image  has  been  loaded,  it can  be  directly
        converted  to  a  bitmap  by  using  the  new  FT_Render_Glyph
        function.  Note that this  function takes the glyph image from
        the glyph slot,  and converts it to a  bitmap whose properties
        are returned  in `face.glyph.bitmap', `face.glyph.bitmap_left'
        and `face.glyph.bitmap_top'.  The  original native image might
        be lost after the conversion.

      - When using the new  bit flag FT_LOAD_RENDER, the FT_Load_Glyph
        and   FT_Load_Char   functions   will   call   FT_Render_Glyph
        automatically when needed.

  - Reformatted all  modules source  code in order  to get rid  of the
    basic data types redifinitions (i.e. `TT_Int' instead of `FT_Int',
    `T1_Fixed'  instead  of  `FT_Fixed').  Hence  the  format-specific
    prefixes like  `TT_', `T1_',  `T2_' and `CID_'  are only  used for
    relevant structures.


======================================================================

OLD CHANGES FOR BETA 7

  - bug-fixed the  OpenType/CFF parser.  It  now loads and displays my
    two  fonts nicely,  but I'm  pretty certain  that more  testing is
    needed :-)

  - fixed the crummy Type 1 hinter, it now handles accented characters
    correctly (well, the accent is  not always well placed, but that's
    another problem..)

  - added the CID-keyed Type 1 driver in `src/cid'.  Works pretty well
    for only 13 Kb of code  ;-) Doesn't read AFM files though, nor the
    really useful CMAP files..

  - fixed  two  bugs  in  the  smooth  renderer  (src/base/ftgrays.c).
    Thanks to Boris Letocha for spotting them and providing a fix.

  - fixed potential `divide by zero' bugs in ftcalc.c.

  - added source  code for  the OpenType/CFF driver  (still incomplete
    though..)

  - modified the  SFNT driver slightly  to perform more  robust header
    checks  in TT_Load_SFNT_Header.  This prevents certain  font files
    (e.g.  some  Type  1  Multiple  Masters)  from  being  incorrectly
    `recognized' as TrueType font files..

  - moved a lot of stuff from  the TrueType driver to the SFNT module,
    this   allows   greater   code   re-use   between   font   drivers
    (e.g. TrueType, OpenType, Compact-TrueType, etc..)

  - added a tiny segment cache to the SFNT Charmap 4 decoder, in order
    to minimally speed it up..

  - added  support for  Multiple Master  fonts in  `type1z'.  There is
    also a new file named <freetype/ftmm.h> which defines functions to
    manage them from client applications.

    The new file `src/base/ftmm.c' is also optional to the engine..

  - various  formatting changes (e.g.  EXPORT_DEF ->  FT_EXPORT_DEF) +
    small bug fixes in FT_Load_Glyph, the `type1' driver, etc..

  - a minor fix to the Type 1 driver to let them apply the font matrix
    correctly (used for many oblique fonts..)

  - some fixes for 64-bit systems (mainly changing some FT_TRACE calls
    to use %p instead of %lx).  Thanks to Karl Robillard.

  - fixed  some bugs  in  the sbit  loader (src/base/sfnt/ttsbit.c)  +
    added  a new flag,  FT_LOAD_CROP_BITMAP to  query that  bitmaps be
    cropped when  loaded from a file  (maybe I should  move the bitmap
    cropper to the base layer ??).

  - changed the default  number of gray levels of  the smooth renderer
    to 256  (instead of  the previous 128).  Of course, the  human eye
    can't see any difference ;-)

  - removed TT_MAX_SUBGLYPHS,  there is no static limit  on the number
    of subglyphs in a TrueType font now..


======================================================================

OLD CHANGES 16 May 2000

  - tagged `BETA-6'  in the  CVS tree.  This one is a  serious release
    candidate even though it doesn't incorporate the auto-hinter yet..

  - various obsolete files were removed, and copyright header updated

  - finally  updated  the  standard   raster  to  fix  the  monochrome
    rendering bug + re-enable  support for 5-gray levels anti-aliasing
    (suck, suck..)

  - created new header files, and modified sources accordingly:

     <freetype/fttypes.h>
       - simple FreeType types, without the API
     <freetype/internal/ftmemory.h>
       - definition of memory-management macros

  - added   the   `DSIG'   (OpenType   Digital   Signature)   tag   to
    <freetype/tttags.h>

  - light update/cleaning of the build system + changes to the sources
    in  order  to  get  rid  of _all_  compiler  warnings  with  three
    compilers, i.e:

    gcc with `-ansi -pedantic -Wall -W', Visual C++ with `/W3 /WX' and
    LCC

    IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WIN32-LCC USERS:
    |
    |  It seems the C pre-processor  that comes with LCC is broken, it
    |  doesn't  recognize  the  ANSI  standard  directives  #  and  ##
    |  correctly   when  one  of   the  argument  is  a  macro.  Also,
    |  something like:
    |
    |     #define F(x)  print##x
    |
    |     F(("hello"))
    |
    |  will get incorrectly translated to:
    |
    |     print "hello")
    |
    |  by its pre-processor.  For this reason, you simply cannot build
    |  FreeType 2 in debug mode with this compiler..

  - yet  another massive grunt work.  I've  changed the  definition of
    the EXPORT_DEF,  EXPORT_FUNC, BASE_DEF &  BASE_FUNC macros.  These
    now take an argument, which is the function's return value type.

    This  is necessary to  compile FreeType  as a  DLL on  Windows and
    OS/2.  Depending on the compiler used, a compiler-specific keyword
    like  __export or __system  must be  placed before  (VisualC++) or
    after (BorlandC++) the type..

    Of course, this needed a lot of changes throughout the source code
    to make it compile again...  All cleaned up now, apparently..

    Note also  that there is a  new EXPORT_VAR macro  defined to allow
    the   _declaration_    of   an   exportable    public   (constant)
    variable.  This  is  the   case  of  the  raster  interfaces  (see
    ftraster.h and ftgrays.h), as well as each module's interface (see
    sfdriver.h, psdriver.h, etc..)

  - new feature: it  is now possible to pass  extra parameters to font
                 drivers  when creating  a new  face object.  For now,
                 this capability is unused.  It could however prove to
                 be useful in a near future..

      the FT_Open_Args structure was  changes, as well as the internal
      driver interface  (the specific `init_face'  module function has
      now a different signature).

  - updated the tutorial (not finished though).

  - updated the top-level BUILD  document

  - fixed  a  potential memory  leak  that  could  occur when  loading
    embedded bitmaps.

  - added     the     declaration     of     FT_New_Memory_Face     in
    <freetype/freetype.h>, as  it was  missing from the  public header
    (the implementation was already in `ftobjs.c').

  - the file <freetype/fterrors.h> has been seriously updated in order
    to allow  the automatic generation  of error message tables.   See
    the comments within it for more information.

  - major directory  hierarchy re-organisation.  This was done for two
    things:

      * first,  to ease  the `manual'  compilation of  the  library by
        requiring at lot less include paths :-)

      * second,  to  allow  external  programs to  effectively  access
        internal  data  fields.  For example,  this  can be  extremely
        useful if  someone wants  to write a  font producer or  a font
        manager on top of FreeType.

    Basically, you  should now use  the 'freetype/' prefix  for header
    inclusion, as in:

        #include <freetype/freetype.h>
        #include <freetype/ftglyph.h>

    Some new include sub-directories are available:

     a. the  `freetype/config' directory,  contains two files  used to
        configure  the  build  of  the  library.  Client  applications
        should  not need  to look  at these  normally, but they can if
        they want.

        #include <freetype/config/ftoption.h>
        #include <freetype/config/ftconfig.h>

     b. the `freetype/internal'  directory, contains header files that
        describes library  internals.  These are the header files that
        were  previously  found  in  the `src/base'  and  `src/shared'
        directories.


    As  usual, the build  system and  the demos  have been  updated to
    reflect the change..

    Here's a layout of the new directory hierarchy:

    TOP_DIR
      include/
         freetype/
            freetype.h
            ...
            config/
              ftoption.h
              ftconfig.h
              ftmodule.h

            internal/
              ftobjs.h
              ftstream.h
              ftcalc.h
              ...

      src/
         base/
            ...

         sfnt/
         psnames/
         truetype/
         type1/
         type1z/


    Compiling a module is now  much easier, for example, the following
    should work when in the TOP_DIR directory on an ANSI build:

       gcc -c -I./include -I./src/base src/base/ftbase.c
       gcc -c -I./include -I./src/sfnt src/sfnt/sfnt.c
       etc..

    (of course, using -Iconfig/<system> if you provide system-specific
     configuration files).

  - updated the structure of FT_Outline_Funcs in order to allow direct
    coordinate scaling within  the outline decomposition routine (this
    is  important for virtual  `on' points  with TrueType  outlines) +
    updates to the rasters to support this..

  - updated  the OS/2  table  loading code  in `src/sfnt/ttload.c'  in
    order to support version 2 of the table (see OpenType 1.2 spec)

  - created  `include/tttables.h'  and  `include/t1tables.h' to  allow
    client applications to access some of  the SFNT and T1 tables of a
    face  with  a  procedural  interface (see  `FT_Get_Sfnt_Table')  +
    updates to internal source files to reflect the change..

  - some  cleanups in  the source  code to  get rid  of  warnings when
    compiling with the `-Wall -W -ansi -pedantic' options in gcc.

  - debugged and moved the smooth renderer to `src/base/ftgrays.c' and
    its header to `include/ftgrays.h'

  - updated TT_MAX_SUBGLYPHS  to 96 as some CJK  fonts have composites
    with up to 80 sub-glyphs !! Thanks to Werner


======================================================================

OLD CHANGES - 14-apr-2000

  - fixed  a bug  in  the  TrueType glyph  loader  that prevented  the
    correct loading of some CJK glyphs in mingli.ttf

  - improved the standard Type 1 hinter in `src/type1'

  - fixed two bugs  in the experimental Type 1  driver in `src/type1z'
    to handle the new XFree86 4.0 fonts (and a few other ones..)

  - the smooth  renderer is now  complete and supports  sub-banding to
    render large glyphs  at high speed.  However, it is still  located
    in `demos/src/ftgrays.c' and should move to the  library itself in
    the next  beta.  NOTE: The  smooth  renderer  doesn't  compile  in
    stand-alone mode anymore, but this should be fixed RSN..

  - introduced convenience  functions to  more easily deal  with glyph
    images, see  `include/ftglyph.h' for more details, as  well as the
    new  demo program  named `demos/src/ftstring.c'  that demonstrates
    its use

  - implemented  FT_LOAD_NO_RECURSE in  both the  TrueType and  Type 1
    drivers  (this  is required  by  the  auto-hinter  to improve  its
    results).

  - changed   the  raster   interface,  in   order  to   allow  client
    applications  to   provide  their   own  span-drawing   callbacks.
    However,   only   the   smooth   renderer   supports   this.   See
    `FT_Raster_Params' in the file `include/ftimage.h'.

  - fixed  a small bug  in FT_MulFix  that caused  incorrect transform
    computation!

  - Note: The tutorial is out-of-date.


======================================================================

OLD CHANGES - 12-mar-2000

  - changed  the  layout  of  configuration  files  :  now,  all  ANSI
    configuration         files         are         located         in
    `freetype2/config'.  System-specific over-rides  can be  placed in
    `freetype2/config/<system>'.

  - moved all configuration macros to `config/ftoption.h'

  - improvements in the Type 1 driver with AFM support

  - changed the fields  in the FT_Outline structure :  the old `flags'
    array is re-named `tags', while all ancient flags are encoded into
    a single unsigned int named `flags'.

  - introduced     new      flags     in     FT_Outline.flags     (see
    ft_outline_.... enums in `ftimage.h').

  - changed outline functions to `FT_Outline_<action>' syntax

  - added a smooth anti-alias renderer to the demonstration programs

  - added Mac graphics driver (thanks Just)

  - FT_Open_Face  changed  in  order   to  received  a  pointer  to  a
    FT_Open_Args descriptor..

  - various  cleanups,  a  few  more API  functions  implemented  (see
    FT_Attach_File)

  - updated some docs


======================================================================

OLD CHANGES - 22-feb-2000

  - introduced the `psnames' module.  It is used to:

      o convert  a Postscript glyph  name into the  equivalent Unicode
        character code (used by the  Type 1 driver(s) to synthesize on
        the fly a Unicode charmap).

      o provide an  interface to retrieve the Postscript  names of the
        Macintosh,  Adobe  Standard &  Adobe  Expert character  codes.
        (the Macintosh  names are  used by the  SFNT-module postscript
        names support routines, while the other two tables are used by
        the Type 1 driver(s)).

  - introduced the `type1z' alternate Type 1 driver.  This is a (still
    experimental) driver  for the Type  1 format that  will ultimately
    replace the one  in `src/type1'.  It uses pattern matching to load
    data from the font, instead of a finite  state analyzer.  It works
    much better than the `old' driver with `broken' fonts.  It is also
    much smaller (under 15 Kb).

  - the  Type 1  drivers (both  in `src/type1'  and  `src/type1z') are
    nearly  complete.  They  both  provide automatic  Unicode  charmap
    synthesis through  the `psnames' module.  No re-encoding vector is
    needed.  (note  that they  still  leak  memory  due to  some  code
    missing, and I'm getting lazy).

    Trivial AFM support has been added to read kerning information but
    wasn't exactly tested as it should ;-)

  - The TrueType  glyph loader has  been seriously rewritten  (see the
    file  `src/truetype/ttgload.c'.  It is now  much, much  simpler as
    well as  easier to read,  maintain and understand  :-) Preliminary
    versions introduced a  memory leak that has been  reported by Jack
    Davis, and is now fixed..

  - introduced  the new  `ft_glyph_format_plotter', used  to represent
    stroked outlines  like Windows `Vector' fonts, and  certain Type 1
    fonts  like `Hershey'.  The corresponding  raster will  be written
    soon.

  - FT_New_Memory_Face  is  gone.  Likewise,  FT_Open_Face has  a  new
    interface that uses a structure  to describe the input stream, the
    driver (if required), etc..


TODO

  - Write FT_Get_Glyph_Bitmap and FT_Load_Glyph_Bitmap

  - Add a function like FT_Load_Character(face, char_code, load_flags)
    that  would   really  embed  a  call   to  FT_Get_Char_Index  then
    FT_Load_Glyph to ease developer's work.

  - Update the tutorial!

  - consider adding  support for Multiple  Master fonts in the  Type 1
    drivers.

  - Test the AFM routines of the  Type 1 drivers to check that kerning
    information is returned correctly.

  - write a decent auto-gridding component  !! We need this to release
    FreeType 2.0 gold !


less urgent needs:

  - add a CFF/Type2 driver
  - add a BDF driver
  - add a FNT/PCF/HBF driver
  - add a Speedo driver from the X11 sources


======================================================================

OLDER CHANGES - 27-jan-2000

  - updated the  `sfnt' module  interface to allow  several SFNT-based
    drivers to co-exist peacefully

  - updated  the `T1_Face'  type  to better  separate Postscript  font
    content  from the  rest of  the FT_Face  structure.  Might be used
    later by the CFF/Type2 driver..

  - added an experimental replacement Type 1 driver featuring advanced
    (and speedy) pattern matching to retrieve the data from postscript
    fonts.

  - very minor  changes in the implementation  of FT_Set_Char_Size and
    FT_Set_Pixel_Sizes (they now implement default to lighten the font
    driver's code).


======================================================================

OLD MESSAGE

This file summarizes the changes  that occurred  since the last `beta'
of FreeType 2. Because the list is important, it has been divided into
separate sections:

Table Of Contents:

    I   High-Level Interface (easier !)
   II   Directory Structure
  III   Glyph Image Formats
   IV   Build System
    V   Portability
   VI   Font Drivers


----------------------------------------------------------------------

High-Level Interface:

  The high-level API has been considerably simplified.  Here is how:

    - resource objects have disappeared.  this means that face objects
      can now be created with  a single function call (see FT_New_Face
      and FT_Open_Face)

    - when calling  either FT_New_Face  & FT_Open_Face, a  size object
      and a glyph slot object  are automatically created for the face,
      and can  be accessed  through `face->glyph' and  `face->size' if
      one really  needs to.   In most cases,  there's no need  to call
      FT_New_Size or FT_New_Glyph.

    - similarly,  FT_Load_Glyph  now  only  takes  a  `face'  argument
      (instead  of a  glyph  slot  and a  size).  Also,  its  `result'
      parameter is  gone, as the glyph  image type is  returned in the
      field `face->glyph.format'

    - the list  of available  charmaps is directly  accessible through
      `face->charmaps', counting `face->num_charmaps'  elements.  Each
      charmap  has an  'encoding'  field which  specifies which  known
      encoding it deals with.  Valid values are, for example:

          ft_encoding_unicode      (for ASCII, Latin-1 and Unicode)
          ft_encoding_apple_roman
          ft_encoding_sjis
          ft_encoding_adobe_standard
          ft_encoding_adobe_expert

      other  values may  be added  in the  future.  Each charmap still
      holds  its `platform_id'  and `encoding_id'  values in  case the
      encoding is too exotic for the current library


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Directory Structure:

  Should seem obvious to most of you:

     freetype/
         config/        -- configuration sub-makefiles
            ansi/
            unix/       -- platform-specific configuration files
            win32/
            os2/
            msdos/

         include/       -- public header  files, those to  be included
                           directly by client apps

         src/           -- sources of the library
           base/        -- the base layer
           sfnt/        -- the sfnt `driver'  (see the drivers section
                           below)
           truetype/    -- the truetype driver
           type1/       -- the type1 driver
           shared/      -- some header files shared between drivers

         demos/         -- demos/tools

         docs/          -- documentation (a bit empty for now)


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Glyph Image Formats:

  Drivers are now able to  register new glyph image formats within the
  library.  For  now, the  base layer supports  of course  bitmaps and
  vector  outlines, but  one  could imagine  something different  like
  colored bitmaps, bi-color vectors or whatever else (Metafonts anyone
  ??).

  See  the   file  `include/ftimage.h'.   Note  also  that   the  type
  FT_Raster_Map  is gone,  and  is now  replaced  by FT_Bitmap,  which
  should encompass all known bitmap types.

  Each new  image format  must provide at  least one `raster',  i.e. a
  module capable of  transforming the glyph image into a bitmap.  It's
  also possible  to change the default  raster used for  a given glyph
  image format.

  The default outline  scan-converter now uses 128 levels  of grays by
  default,  which tends  to smooth  many  things.  Note that the  demo
  programs have been updated significantly in order to display these..


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Build system:

  You still need  GNU Make to build the library.  The build system has
  been very seriously re-vamped in order to provide things like :

   - automatic host platform  detection (reverting to 'config/ansi' if
     it is not detected, with pseudo-standard compilation flags)

   - the ability to compile from the Makefiles with very different and
     exotic compilers.  Note that linking the library can be difficult
     for some platforms.

     For example, the file `config/win32/lcclib.bat' is invoked by the
     build system to create the `.lib' file with LCC-Win32 because its
     librarian  has too  many flaws  to be  invoked directly  from the
     Makefile.

  Here's how it works:

  - the first time you type `make',  the build system runs a series of
    sub-makefiles  in order  to detect  your host  platform.  It  then
    dumps what it found, and creates a file called `config.mk' in  the
    current  directory.  This is a  sub-Makefile used  to  define many
    important Make variables used to build the library.

  - the second time, the build system detects the `config.mk' then use
    it  to  build the  library.  All object  files  go  into 'obj'  by
    default,  as well  as the  library file,  but this  can  easily be
    changed.

  Note that  you can run `make  setup' to force  another host platform
  detection  even   if  a  `config.mk'  is  present   in  the  current
  directory.  Another solution  is  simply to  delete  the file,  then
  re-run make.

  Finally, the  default compiler  for all platforms  is gcc  (for now,
  this will hopefully changed in the future).  You can however specify
  a different  compiler by specifying  it after the 'setup'  target as
  in:

      gnumake setup lcc         on Win32 to use the LCC compiler
      gnumake setup visualc     on Win32 to use Visual C++

  See  the file  `config/<system>/detect.mk' for  a list  of supported
  compilers for your platforms.

  It should be relatively easy  to write new detection rules files and
  config.mk..

  Finally, to  build the demo programs,  go to `demos'  and launch GNU
  Make, it will use the `config.mk'  in the top directory to build the
  test programs..


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Portability:

  In  the  previous  beta,  a  single FT_System  object  was  used  to
  encompass  all  low-level  operations like  thread  synchronisation,
  memory management and i/o access.  This has been greatly simplified:

    - thread synchronisation  has been dropped, for  the simple reason
      that the library  is already re-entrant, and that  if you really
      need  two  threads accessing  the  same  FT_Library, you  should
      really synchronize access to it yourself with a simple mutex.

    - memory  management is  performed  through a  very simple  object
      called `FT_Memory',  which really is a table  containing a table
      of pointers to  functions like malloc, realloc and  free as well
      as some user data (closure).

    - resources have disappeared (they created more problems than they
      solved), and  i/o management have  been simplified greatly  as a
      result.  Streams are  defined through  FT_Stream objects,  which
      can be either memory-based or disk-based.

      Note that  each face  has its own  stream, which is  closed only
      when  the  face object  is  destroyed.  Hence,  a function  like
      TT_Flush_Face in 1.x cannot be directly  supported.  However, if
      you really need something like  this, you can easily tailor your
      own streams  to achieve the same  feature at a  lower level (and
      use FT_Open_Face instead of FT_New_Face to create the face).

  See the file  `include/ftsystem.h' for more details, as  well as the
  implementations found in `config/unix' and `config/ansi'.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Font Drivers:

  The  Font Driver  interface has  been modified  in order  to support
  extensions & versioning.


  The  list of  the font  drivers that  are statically  linked  to the
  library at compile time is  managed through a new configuration file
  called `config/<platform>/ftmodule.h'.

  This  file is  autogenerated  when  invoking  `make modules'.   This
  target  will  parse  all  sub-directories  of  'src', looking  for a
  `module.mk' rules  file, used  to describe  the driver to  the build
  system.

  Hence, one  should call  `make modules' each  time a font  driver is
  added or removed from the `src' directory.

  Finally, this  version  provides  a `pseudo-driver'  in  `src/sfnt'.
  This  driver  doesn't  support  font  files  directly, but  provides
  services used by all TrueType-like font drivers.  Hence, its code is
  shared between  the TrueType & OpenType  font formats,  and possibly
  more formats to come if we're lucky..


----------------------------------------------------------------------

Extensions support:

  The extensions support is inspired by the one found in 1.x.

  Now, each font driver has  its own `extension registry', which lists
  which extensions  are available  for the font  faces managed  by the
  driver.

  Extension ids are  now strings, rather than 4-byte  tags, as this is
  usually more readable.

  Each extension has:
    - some data, associated to each face object
    - an interface (table of function pointers)

  An extension  that is format-specific should  simply register itself
  to the correct font driver.  Here is some example code:

   // Registering an extensions
   //
   FT_Error  FT_Init_XXXX_Extension( FT_Library  library )
   {
     FT_DriverInterface*  tt_driver;

     driver = FT_Get_Driver( library, "truetype" );
     if (!driver) return FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature;

     return FT_Register_Extension( driver, &extension_class );
   }


   // Implementing the extensions
   //
   FT_Error  FT_Proceed_Extension_XXX( FT_Face  face )
   {
     FT_XXX_Extension            ext;
     FT_XXX_Extension_Interface  ext_interface;

     ext = FT_Get_Extension( face, "extensionid", &ext_interface );
     if (!ext) return error;

     return ext_interface->do_it(ext);
   }
