    Qt Style Sheets are a powerful mechanism that allows you to
    customize the appearance of widgets, in addition to what is
    already possible by subclassing QStyle. The concepts,
    terminology, and syntax of Qt Style Sheets are heavily inspired
    by HTML \l{http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/}{Cascading Style Sheets
    (CSS)} but adapted to the world of widgets.

    \target overview
    \section1 Overview

    Styles sheets are textual specifications that can be set on the
    whole application using QApplication::setStyleSheet() or on a
    specific widget (and its children) using
    QWidget::setStyleSheet(). If several style sheets are set at
    different levels, Qt derives the effective style sheet from all
    of those that are set. This is called cascading.

    For example, the following style sheet specifies that all
    \l{QLineEdit}s should use yellow as their background color, and
    all \l{QCheckBox}es should use red as the text color:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 0

    For this kind of customization, style sheets are much more
    powerful than QPalette. For example, it might be tempting to set
    the QPalette::Button role to red for a QPushButton to obtain a
    red push button. However, this wasn't guaranteed to work for all
    styles, because style authors are restricted by the different
    platforms' guidelines and (on Windows XP and Mac OS X) by the
    native theme engine.

    Style sheets let you perform all kinds of customizations that are
    difficult or impossible to perform using QPalette alone. If you
    want yellow backgrounds for mandatory fields, red text for
    potentially destructive push buttons, or fancy check boxes, style
    sheets are the answer.

    Style sheets are applied on top of the current \l{QStyle}{widget
    style}, meaning that your applications will look as native as
    possible, but any style sheet constraints will be taken into
    consideration. Unlike palette fiddling, style sheets offer
    guarantees: If you set the background color of a QPushButton to be
    red, you can be assured that the button will have a red background
    in all styles, on all platforms. In addition, Qt Designer
    provides style sheet integration, making it easy to view the effects
    of a style sheet in different \l{QStyle}{widget styles}.

    In addition, style sheets can be used to provide a distinctive
    look and feel for your application, without having to subclass
    QStyle. For example, you can specify arbitrary images for radio
    buttons and check boxes to make them stand out. Using this
    technique, you can also achieve minor customizations that would
    normally require subclassing several style classes, such as
    specifying a \l{QStyle::styleHint()}{style hint}. The
    \l{widgets/stylesheet}{Style Sheet} example depicted below defines
    two distinctive style sheets that you can try out and modify at
    will.

    \endtable

    When a style sheet is active, the QStyle returned by QWidget::style()
    is a wrapper "style sheet" style, \e not the platform-specific style. The
    wrapper style ensures that any active style sheet is respected and
    otherwise forwards the drawing operations to the underlying,
    platform-specific style (e.g., QWindowsXPStyle on Windows XP).

    Since Qt 4.5, Qt style sheets fully supports Mac OS X.

    \warning Qt style sheets are currently not supported for custom QStyle
    subclasses. We plan to address this in some future release.

    \title The Style Sheet Syntax

    Qt Style Sheet terminology and syntactic rules are almost
    identical to those of HTML CSS. If you already know CSS, you can
    probably skim quickly through this section.

    \tableofcontents

    \section1 Style Rules

    Style sheets consist of a sequence of style rules. A \e{style
    rule} is made up of a selector and a declaration. The
    \e{selector} specifies which widgets are affected by the rule;
    the \e{declaration} specifies which properties should be set on
    the widget. For example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 1

    In the above style rule, \c QPushButton is the selector and \c{{
    color: red }} is the declaration. The rule specifies that
    QPushButton and its subclasses (e.g., \c MyPushButton) should use
    red as their foreground color.

    Qt Style Sheet is generally case insensitive (i.e., \c color,
    \c Color, \c COLOR, and \c cOloR refer to the same property).
    The only exceptions are class names,
    \l{QObject::setObjectName()}{object names}, and Qt property
    names, which are case sensitive.

    Several selectors can be specified for the same declaration,
    using commas (\c{,}) to separate the selectors. For example,
    the rule

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 2

    is equivalent to this sequence of three rules:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 3

    The declaration part of a style rule is a list of
    \tt{\e{property}: \e{value}} pairs, enclosed in braces (\c{{}})
    and separated with semicolons. For example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 4

    See the \l{List of Properties} section below for the list of
    properties provided by Qt widgets.

    \section1 Selector Types

    All the examples so far used the simplest type of selector, the
    Type Selector. Qt Style Sheets support all the
    \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/selector.html#q1}{selectors
    defined in CSS2}. The table below summarizes the most useful
    types of selectors.

    \table 100%
    \header
        \li Selector
        \li Example
        \li Explanation

    \row
        \li Universal Selector
        \li \c *
        \li Matches all widgets.

    \row
        \li Type Selector
        \li \c QPushButton
        \li Matches instances of QPushButton and of its subclasses.

    \row
        \li Property Selector
        \li \c{QPushButton[flat="false"]}
        \li Matches instances of QPushButton that are not
           \l{QPushButton::}{flat}. You may use this selector to test
           for any Qt \l{Qt's Property System}{property} that supports
           QVariant::toString() (see the \l{QVariant::}{toString()}
           function documentation for details). In addition, the
           special \c class property is supported, for the name of the
           class.

           This selector may also be used to test dynamic properties.
           For more information on customization using dynamic properties,
           refer to \l{Customizing Using Dynamic Properties}.

           Instead of \c =, you can also use \c ~= to test whether a
           Qt property of type QStringList contains a given QString.

           \warning If the value of the Qt property changes after the
           style sheet has been set, it might be necessary to force a
           style sheet recomputation. One way to achieve this is to
           unset the style sheet and set it again.

    \row
        \li Class Selector
        \li \c .QPushButton
        \li Matches instances of QPushButton, but not of its subclasses.

           This is equivalent to \c{*[class~="QPushButton"]}.

    \row
        \li ID \target ID Selector
           Selector
        \li \c{QPushButton#okButton}
        \li Matches all QPushButton instances whose
           \l{QObject::objectName}{object name} is \c okButton.

    \row
        \li Descendant Selector
        \li \c{QDialog QPushButton}
        \li Matches all instances of QPushButton that are descendants
           (children, grandchildren, etc.) of a QDialog.

    \row
        \li Child Selector
        \li \c{QDialog > QPushButton}
        \li Matches all instances of QPushButton that are direct
           children of a QDialog.
    \endtable

    \section1 Sub-Controls

    For styling complex widgets, it is necessary to access subcontrols of the
    widget, such as the drop-down button of a QComboBox or the up and down
    arrows of a QSpinBox. Selectors may contain \e{subcontrols} that make it
    possible to restrict the application of a rule to specific widget
    subcontrols. For example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 5

    The above rule styles the drop-down button of all \l{QComboBox}es.
    Although the double-colon (\c{::}) syntax is reminiscent of CSS3
    Pseudo-Elements, Qt Sub-Controls differ conceptually from these and have
    different cascading semantics.

    Sub-controls are always positioned with respect to another element - a
    reference element. This reference element could be the widget or another
    Sub-control. For example, the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#drop-down-sub}
    {::drop-down} of a QComboBox is placed, by default, in the top right corner
    of the Padding rectangle of the QComboBox. The
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#drop-down-sub}{::drop-down} is placed,
    by default, in the Center of the Contents rectangle of the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#drop-down-sub}{::drop-down} Sub-control. See
    the \l{List of Stylable Widgets} below for the Sub-controls to use to
    style a widget and their default positions.

    The origin rectangle to be used can be changed using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}
    property. For example, if we want to place the drop-down in the margin
    rectangle of the QComboBox instead of the default Padding rectangle, we
    can specify:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 6

    The alignment of the drop-down within the Margin rectangle is changed
    using \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-position-prop}
    {subcontrol-position} property.

    The \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#width-prop}{width} and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#height-prop}{height} properties can be used
    to control the size of the Sub-control. Note that setting a
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#image-prop}{image} implicitly sets the size
    of a Sub-control.

    The relative positioning scheme
    (\l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#position-prop}{position} : relative),
    allows the position of the Sub-Control to be offset from its initial
    position. For example, when the QComboBox's drop-down button is
    pressed, we might like the arrow inside to be offset to give a
    "pressed" effect. To achieve this, we can specify:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 7

    The absolute positioning scheme
    (\l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#position-prop}{position} : absolute),
    allows the position and size of the Sub-control to be changed with
    respect to the reference element.

    Once positioned, they are treated the same as widgets and can be styled
    using the \l{box model}.

    See the \l{List of Sub-Controls} below for a list of supported
    sub-controls, and \l{Customizing the QPushButton's Menu Indicator
    Sub-Control} for a realistic example.

    \note With complex widgets such as QComboBox and QScrollBar, if one
    property or sub-control is customized, \b{all} the other properties or
    sub-controls must be customized as well.

    \section1 Pseudo-States

    Selectors may contain \e{pseudo-states} that denote that restrict
    the application of the rule based on the widget's state.
    Pseudo-states appear at the end of the selector, with a colon
    (\c{:}) in between. For example, the following rule applies when
    the mouse hovers over a QPushButton:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 8

    Pseudo-states can be negated using the exclamation operator. For
    example, the following rule applies when the mouse does not hover
    over a QRadioButton:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 9

    Pseudo-states can be chained, in which case a logical AND is
    implied. For example, the following rule applies to when the
    mouse hovers over a checked QCheckBox:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 10

    Negated Pseudo-states may appear in Pseudo-state chains. For example,
    the following rule applies when the mouse hovers over a QPushButton
    that is not pressed:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 11

    If needed, logical OR can be expressed using the comma operator:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 12

    Pseudo-states can appear in combination with subcontrols. For
    example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 13

    See the \l{List of Pseudo-States} section below for the list of
    pseudo-states provided by Qt widgets.

    \section1 Conflict Resolution

    Conflicts arise when several style rules specify the same
    properties with different values. Consider the following style
    sheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 14

    Both rules match QPushButton instances called \c okButton and
    there is a conflict for the \c color property. To resolve this
    conflict, we must take into account the \e specificity of the
    selectors. In the above example, \c{QPushButton#okButton} is
    considered more specific than \c QPushButton, because it
    (usually) refers to a single object, not to all instances of a
    class.

    Similarly, selectors with pseudo-states are more specific than
    ones that do not specify pseudo-states. Thus, the following style
    sheet specifies that a \l{QPushButton} should have white text
    when the mouse is hovering over it, otherwise red text:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 15

    Here's a tricky one:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 16

    Here, both selectors have the same specificity, so if the mouse
    hovers over the button while it is enabled, the second rule takes
    precedence. If we want the text to be white in that case, we can
    reorder the rules like this:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 17

    Alternatively, we can make the first rule more specific:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 18

    A similar issue arises in conjunction with Type Selectors.
    Consider the following example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 19

    Both rules apply to QPushButton instances (since QPushButton
    inherits QAbstractButton) and there is a conflict for the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#color-prop}{color} property. Because QPushButton
    inherits QAbstractButton, it might be tempting to assume that
    \c QPushButton is more specific than \c QAbstractButton. However,
    for style sheet computations, all Type Selectors have the same
    specificity, and the rule that appears last takes precedence. In
    other words, \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#color-prop}{color} is set to \c gray
    for all \l{QAbstractButton}s, including \l{QPushButton}s. If we really
    want \l{QPushButton}s to have red text, we can always reorder the
    rules.

    For determining the specificity of a rule, Qt Style Sheets follow
    the
    \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/cascade.html#specificity}{CSS2
    Specification}:

    \quotation
    \e{A selector's specificity is calculated as follows:}

    \list
    \li \e{count the number of ID attributes in the selector (= a)}
    \li \e{count the number of other attributes and pseudo-classes in the selector (= b)}
    \li \e{count the number of element names in the selector (= c)}
    \li \e{ignore pseudo-elements [i.e., \l{subcontrols}].}
    \endlist

    \e{Concatenating the three numbers a-b-c (in a number system with a
    large base) gives the specificity.}

    \e{Some examples:}

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 20
    \endquotation

    \section1 Cascading

    Style sheets can be set on the QApplication, on parent widgets,
    and on child widgets. An arbitrary widget's effective style sheet
    is obtained by merging the style sheets set on the widget's
    ancestors (parent, grandparent, etc.), as well as any style sheet
    set on the QApplication.

    When conflicts arise, the widget's own style sheet is always
    preferred to any inherited style sheet, irrespective of the
    specificity of the conflicting rules. Likewise, the parent
    widget's style sheet is preferred to the grandparent's, etc.

    One consequence of this is that setting a style rule on a widget
    automatically gives it precedence over other rules specified in
    the ancestor widgets' style sheets or the QApplication style
    sheet. Consider the following example. First, we set a style
    sheet on the QApplication:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 21

    Then we set a style sheet on a QPushButton object:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 22

    The style sheet on the QPushButton forces the QPushButton (and
    any child widget) to have blue text, in spite of the more
    specific rule set provided by the application-wide style sheet.

    The result would have been the same if we had written

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 23

    except that if the QPushButton had children (which is unlikely),
    the style sheet would have no impact on them.

    Style sheet cascading is a complex topic. Refer to the
    \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/cascade.html#cascade}{CSS2
    Specification} for the gory details. Be aware that Qt currently
    doesn't implement \c{!important}.

    \section1 Inheritance

    In classic CSS, when font and color of an item is not explicitly set,
    it gets automatically inherited from the parent. When using Qt Style Sheets,
    a widget does \b{not} automatically inherit its font and color setting
    from its parent widget.

    For example, consider a QPushButton inside a QGroupBox:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 24

    The QPushButton does not have an explicit color set. Hence, instead
    of inheriting color of its parent QGroupBox, it has the system color.
    If we want to set the color on a QGroupBox and its children,
    we can write:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 25

    In contrast, setting a font and propagate using QWidget::setFont() and
    QWidget::setPalette() propagates to child widgets.

    \section1 Widgets inside C++ namespaces

    The Type Selector can be used to style widgets of a particular type. For
    example,

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 26

    Qt Style Sheet uses QObject::className() of the widget to determine
    when to apply the Type Selector. When custom widgets are inside namespaces,
    the QObject::className() returns <namespace>::<classname>. This conflicts
    with the syntax for \l{Sub-Controls}. To overcome this problem,
    when using the Type Selector for widgets inside namespaces, we must
    replace the "::" with "--". For example,

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 27

    \section1 Setting QObject properties

    From 4.3 and above, any designable Q_PROPERTY
    can be set using the qproperty-<property name> syntax.

    For example,
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 28

    If the property references an enum declared with Q_ENUMS, you should
    reference its constants by name, i.e., not their numeric value.

    \title Customizing Qt Widgets Using Style Sheets

    When using style sheets, every widget is treated as a box with four
    concentric rectangles: the margin rectangle, the border rectangle, the
    padding rectangle, and the content rectangle. The box model describes
    this in further detail.

    \tableofcontents

    \target box model
    \section1 The Box Model

    The four concentric rectangles appear conceptually as below:

    \image stylesheet-boxmodel.png

    \list
    \li The margin falls outside the border.
    \li The border is drawn between the margin and the padding.
    \li The padding falls inside the border, between the border and
       the actual contents.
    \li The content is what is left from the original widget or
       subcontrol once we have removed the margin, the border, and
       the padding.
    \endlist

    The \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#margin-prop}{margin},
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#border-width-prop}
    {border-width}, and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#padding-prop}{padding}
    properties all default to zero. In that case, all four rectangles
    (\c margin, \c border, \c padding, and \c content) coincide exactly.

    You can specify a background for the widget using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-image-prop}{background-image}
    property. By default, the background-image is drawn only for the area
    inside the border. This can be changed using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-clip-prop}{background-clip}
    property. You can use
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-repeat-prop}{background-repeat}
    and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-origin-prop}{background-origin}
    to control the repetition and origin of the background image.

    A background-image does not scale with the size of the widget. To provide
    a "skin" or background that scales along with the widget size, one must
    use
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#border-image-prop}{border-image}. Since the
    border-image property provides an alternate background, it is not required
    to specify a background-image when border-image is specified. In the case,
    when both of them are specified, the border-image draws over the
    background-image.

    In addition, the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#image-prop}{image} property
    may be used to draw an image over the border-image. The image specified does
    not tile or stretch and when its size does not match the size of the widget,
    its alignment is specified using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#image-position-prop}{image-position}
    property. Unlike background-image and border-image, one may specify a
    SVG in the image property, in which case the image is scaled automatically
    according to the widget size.

    The steps to render a rule are as follows:
        \list
        \li Set clip for entire rendering operation (border-radius)
        \li Draw the background (background-image)
        \li Draw the border (border-image, border)
        \li Draw overlay image (image)
        \endlist

    \target sub controls
    \section1 Sub-controls

    A widget is considered as a hierarchy (tree) of subcontrols drawn on top
    of each other. For example, the QComboBox draws the drop-down sub-control
    followed by the down-arrow sub-control. A QComboBox is thus rendered as
    follows:
        \list
        \li Render the QComboBox { } rule
        \li Render the QComboBox::drop-down { } rule
        \li Render the QComboBox::down-arrow { } rule
        \endlist

    Sub-controls share a parent-child relationship. In the case of QComboBox,
    the parent of down-arrow is the drop-down and the parent of drop-down is
    the widget itself. Sub-controls are positioned within their parent using
    the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-position-prop}
    {subcontrol-position} and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}
    properties.

    Once positioned, sub-controls can be styled using the \l{box model}.

    \note With complex widgets such as QComboBox and QScrollBar, if one
    property or sub-control is customized, \b{all} the other properties or
    sub-controls must be customized as well.

    \section1 List of Stylable Widgets

    The following table lists the Qt widgets that can be customized
    using style sheets:

    \table 100%
    \header
        \li Widget
        \li How to Style

    \row
        \li QAbstractScrollArea \target qabstractscrollarea-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}.

           All derivatives of QAbstractScrollArea, including QTextEdit,
           and QAbstractItemView (all item view classes), support
           scrollable backgrounds using
           \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-attachment-prop}
           {background-attachment}. Setting the background-attachment to
           \c{fixed} provides a background-image that does not scroll with the
           viewport. Setting the background-attachment to \c{scroll}, scrolls
           the background-image when the scroll bars move.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QAbstractScrollArea}
           {Customizing QAbstractScrollArea} for an example.

    \row
        \li QCheckBox \target qcheckbox-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The check indicator can be
           styled using the \l{#indicator-sub}{::indicator}
           subcontrol. By default, the indicator is placed in the Top
           Left corner of the Contents rectangle of the widget.

           The \l{#spacing-prop}{spacing} property
           specifies the spacing between the check indicator and
           the text.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QCheckBox}
           {Customizing QCheckBox} for an example.

    \row
        \li QColumnView \target qcolumnview-widget
        \li The grip can be styled be using the \l{image-prop}{image} property.
           The arrow indicators can by styled using the
           \l{left-arrow-sub}{::left-arrow} subcontrol and the
           \l{right-arrow-sub}{::right-arrow} subcontrol.

    \row
        \li QComboBox \target qcombobox-widget
        \li The frame around the combobox can be styled using the
           \l{box model}. The drop-down button can be styled using
           the \l{#drop-down-sub}{::drop-down} subcontrol. By default, the
           drop-down button is placed in the top right corner of the padding
           rectangle of the widget. The arrow mark inside the drop-down button
           can be styled using the \l{#down-arrow-sub}{::down-arrow}
           subcontrol. By default, the arrow is placed in the center of the
           contents rectangle of the drop-down subcontrol.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QComboBox}{Customizing QComboBox}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QDateEdit \target qdateedit-widget
        \li See \l{#qspinbox-widget}{QSpinBox}.

    \row
        \li QDateTimeEdit \target qdatetimeedit-widget
        \li See \l{#qspinbox-widget}{QSpinBox}.

    \row
        \li QDialog \target qdialog-widget
        \li Supports only the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-prop}{background},
           \l{#background-clip-prop}{background-clip} and
           \l{#background-origin-prop}{background-origin} properties.

           \warning Make sure you define the Q_OBJECT macro for your custom
           widget.

    \row
        \li QDialogButtonBox \target qdialogbuttonbox-widget
        \li The layout of buttons can be altered using the
           \l{#button-layout-prop}{button-layout} property.

    \row
        \li QDockWidget \target qdockwidget-widget
        \li Supports styling of the title bar and the title bar buttons when docked.

        The dock widget border can be styled using the \l{#border-prop}{border}
        property. The \l{#title-sub}{::title} subcontrol can be used to customize
        the title bar. The close and float buttons are positioned with respect
        to the \l{title-sub}{::title} subcontrol using the
        \l{#close-button-sub}{::close-button} and
        \l{#float-button-sub}{::float-button} respectively.

        When the title bar is vertical, the \l{#vertical-ps}{:vertical} pseudo
        class is set. In addition, depending on QDockWidget::DockWidgetFeature,
        the \l{#closable-ps}{:closable}, \l{#floatable-ps}{:floatable} and
        \l{#movable-ps}{:movable} pseudo states are set.

        \note Use QMainWindow::separator to style the resize handle.

        \warning The style sheet has no effect when the QDockWidget is undocked
        as Qt uses native top level windows when undocked.

        See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QDockWidget}
        {Customizing QDockWidget} for an example.

    \row
        \li QDoubleSpinBox \target qdoublespinbox-widget
        \li See \l{#qspinbox-widget}{QSpinBox}.

    \row
        \li QFrame \target qframe-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}.

           Since 4.3, setting a stylesheet on a QLabel automatically
           sets the QFrame::frameStyle property to QFrame::StyledPanel.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QFrame}{Customizing QFrame}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QGroupBox \target qgroupbox-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The title can be styled using the
           \l{#title-sub}{::title} subcontrol. By default, the title is placed
           depending on QGroupBox::textAlignment.

           In the case of a checkable QGroupBox, the title includes the
           check indicator. The indicator is styled using the
           \l{#indicator-sub}{::indicator} subcontrol. The
           \l{#spacing-prop}{spacing} property can be used to control
           the spacing between the text and indicator.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QGroupBox}{Customizing QGroupBox}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QHeaderView \target qheaderview-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The sections of the header view are
           styled using the \l{#section-sub}{::section} sub control. The
           \c{section} Sub-control supports the \l{#middle-ps}{:middle},
           \l{#first-ps}{:first}, \l{#last-ps}{:last},
           \l{#only-one-ps}{:only-one}, \l{#next-selected-ps}{:next-selected},
           \l{#previous-selected-ps}{:previous-selected},
           \l{#selected-ps}{:selected},
           and \l{#checked-ps}{:checked} pseudo states.

           Sort indicator in can be styled using the
           \l{#up-arrow-sub}{::up-arrow} and the
           \l{#down-arrow-sub}{::down-arrow} Sub-control.

    \row
        \li QLabel \target qlabel-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. Does not support the
           \l{#hover-ps}{:hover} pseudo-state.

           Since 4.3, setting a stylesheet on a QLabel automatically
           sets the QFrame::frameStyle property to QFrame::StyledPanel.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QFrame}{Customizing QFrame} for an
           example (a QLabel derives from QFrame).

    \row
        \li QLineEdit \target qlineedit-widget
        \li Support the \l{box model}.

           The color and background of the selected item is styled using
           \l{#selection-color-prop}{selection-color} and
           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color}
           respectively.

           The password character can be styled using the
           \l{#lineedit-password-character-prop}{lineedit-password-character}
           property.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QLineEdit}{Customizing QLineEdit}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QListView \target qlistview-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. When
           \l{QAbstractItemView::alternatingRowColors}{alternating row colors}
           is enabled, the alternating colors can be styled using the
           \l{#alternate-background-color-prop}{alternate-background-color}
           property.

           The color and background of the selected item is styled using
           \l{#selection-color-prop}{selection-color} and
           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color}
           respectively.

           The selection behavior is controlled by the
           \l{#show-decoration-selected-prop}{show-decoration-selected} property.

           Use the \l{#item-sub}{::item} subcontrol for more fine grained
           control over the items in the QListView.

           See \l{qabstractscrollarea-widget}{QAbsractScrollArea} to
           style scrollable backgrounds.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QListView}

    \row
        \li QMainWindow \target qmainwindow-widget
        \li Supports styling of the separator

           The separator in a QMainWindow when using QDockWidget is styled
           using the \l{#separator-sub}{::separator} subcontrol.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QMainWindow}{Customizing QMainWindow}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QMenu \target qmenu-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}.

           Individual items are styled using the \l{#item-sub}{::item}
           subcontrol. In addition to the usually supported pseudo states,
           \c{item} subcontrol supports the
           \l{#selected-ps}{:selected}, \l{#default-ps}{:default},
           \l{#exclusive-ps}{:exclusive} and the
           \l{#non-exclusive-ps}{non-exclusive} pseudo states.

           The indicator of checkable menu items is styled using the
           \l{#indicator-sub}{::indicator} subcontrol.

           The separator is styled using the \l{#separator-sub}{::separator}
           subcontrol.

           For items with a sub menu, the arrow marks are styled using the
           \l{right-arrow-sub}{right-arrow} and
           \l{left-arrow-sub}{left-arrow}.

            The scroller is styled using the \l{#scroller-sub}{::scroller}.

            The tear-off is styled using the \l{#tearoff-sub}{::tearoff}.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QMenu}{Customizing QMenu}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QMenuBar \target qmenubar-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The \l{#spacing-prop}{spacing}
           property specifies the spacing between menu items.
           Individual items are styled using the \l{#item-sub}{::item}
           subcontrol.

           \warning When running on Qt/Mac, the menu bar is usually embedded into the
           system-wide menu bar. In this case, the style sheet will have no effect.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QMenuBar}{Customizing QMenuBar}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QMessageBox \target qmessagebox-widget
        \li The \l{#messagebox-text-interaction-flags-prop}
           {messagebox-text-interaction-flags} property can be used to alter
           the interaction with text in the message box.

    \row
        \li QProgressBar \target qprogressbar-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The chunks of the progress bar
           can be styled using the \l{#chunk-sub}{::chunk} subcontrol.
           The chunk is displayed on the Contents rectangle of the widget.

           If the progress bar displays text, use the \l{text-align-prop}{text-align}
           property to position the text.

           Indeterminate progress bars have the
           \l{#indeterminate-ps}{:indeterminate} pseudo state set.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QProgressBar}{Customizing QProgressBar}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QPushButton \target qpushbutton-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. Supports the \l{#default-ps}{:default},
           \l{#flat-ps}{:flat}, \l{#checked-ps}{:checked} pseudo states.

           For QPushButton with a menu, the menu indicator is styled
           using the \l{#menu-indicator-sub}{::menu-indicator}
           subcontrol. Appearance of checkable push buttons can be
           customized using the \l{#open-ps}{:open} and
           \l{#closed-ps}{:closed} pseudo-states.

           \warning If you only set a background-color on a QPushButton, the background
           may not appear unless you set the border property to some value. This is
           because, by default, the QPushButton draws a native border which completely
           overlaps the background-color. For example,

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 30

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QPushButton}{Customizing QPushButton}
           for an example.

        \li QRadioButton \target qradiobutton-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The check indicator can be
           styled using the \l{#indicator-sub}{::indicator}
           subcontrol. By default, the indicator is placed in the Top
           Left corner of the Contents rectangle of the widget.

           The \l{#spacing-prop}{spacing} property
           specifies the spacing between the check indicator and
           the text.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QRadioButton}
           {Customizing QRadioButton} for an example.

    \row
        \li QScrollBar \target qscrollbar-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. The Contents rectangle of the widget
           is considered to be the groove over which the slider moves. The extent
           of the QScrollBar (i.e the width or the height depending on the orientation)
           is set using the \l{#width-prop}{width} or \l{#height-prop}{height} property
           respectively. To determine the orientation, use the
           \l{#horizontal-ps}{:horizontal} and the \l{vertical-ps}{:vertical}
           pseudo states.

           The slider can be styled using the \l{#handle-sub}{::handle} subcontrol.
           Setting the \l{#min-width-prop}{min-width} or \l{#min-height-prop}{min-height}
           provides size contraints for the slider depending on the orientation.

           The \l{add-line-sub}{::add-line} subcontrol can be used to style the
           button to add a line. By default, the add-line subcontrol is placed in
           top right corner of the Border rectangle of the widget. Depending on the
           orientation the \l{#right-arrow-sub}{::right-arrow} or
           \l{#down-arrow-sub}{::down-arrow}. By default, the arrows are placed in
           the center of the Contents rectangle of the add-line subcontrol.

           The \l{sub-line-sub}{::sub-line} subcontrol can be used to style the
           button to subtract a line. By default, the sub-line subcontrol is placed in
           bottom right corner of the Border rectangle of the widget. Depending on the
           orientation the \l{#left-arrow-sub}{::left-arrow} or
           \l{#up-arrow-sub}{::up-arrow}. By default, the arrows are placed in
           the center of the Contents rectangle of the sub-line subcontrol.

           The \l{sub-page-sub}{::sub-page} subcontrol can be used to style the
           region of the slider that subtracts a page. The \l{add-page-sub}{::add-page}
           subcontrol can be used to style the region of the slider that adds a page.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QScrollBar}{Customizing QScrollBar}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QSizeGrip \target qsizegrip-widget
        \li Supports the \l{#width-prop}{width},
           \l{#height-prop}{height}, and \l{#image-prop}{image}
           properties.

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QSizeGrip}{Customizing QSizeGrip}
           for an example.

    \row
        \li QSlider \target qslider-widget
        \li Supports the \l{box model}. For horizontal slides, the
           \l{min-width-prop}{min-width} and \l{height-prop}{height}
           properties must be provided. For vertical sliders, the
           \l{min-height-prop}{min-height} and \l{width-prop}{width}
           properties must be provided.

           The groove of the slider is styled
           using the \l{#groove-sub}{::groove}. The groove is
           positioned by default in the Contents rectangle of the widget.
           The thumb of the slider is styled using \l{#handle-sub}{::handle}
           subcontrol. The subcontrol moves in the Contents rectangle of
           the groove subcontrol.

           \l{#up-button-sub}{::up-button} and
           \l{#up-arrow-sub}{::up-arrow} subcontrols. By default,
           the up-button is placed in the top right corner in the
           Padding rectangle of the widget. Without an explicit size,
           it occupies half the height of its reference rectangle.
           The up-arrow is placed in the center of the Contents
           rectangle of the up-button.

           The down button and arrow can be styled using the
           \l{#down-button-sub}{::down-button} and
           \l{#down-arrow-sub}{::down-arrow} subcontrols. By default,
           the down-button is placed in the bottom right corner in the

            \l{#bottom-ps}{:bottom} pseudo states depending on the orientation
            of the tabs.

            Overlapping tabs for the selected state are created by using
            negative margins or using the \c{absolute} position scheme.

            The tear indicator of the QTabBar is styled using the
            \l{#tear-sub}{::tear} subcontrol.

            QTabBar used two QToolButtons for its scrollers that can be styled
            using the \c{QTabBar QToolButton} selector. To specify the width
            of the scroll button use the \l{#scroller-sub}{::scroller}
            subcontrol.

            The alignment of the tabs within the QTabBar is styled
            using the \l{#Alignment}{alignment} property. \warning

            To change the position of the QTabBar within a QTabWidget, use the
            \l{#tab-bar-sub}{tab-bar} subcontrol (and set subcontrol-position).

           See \l{Qt Style Sheets Examples#Customizing QTabWidget and QTabBar}{Customizing QTabBar}
           for an example.

        \li The frame of the tab widget is styled using the
           \l{#pane-sub}{::pane} subcontrol. The left and right
           corners are styled using the \l{#left-corner-sub}{::left-corner}
           and \l{#right-corner-sub}{::right-corner} respectively.
           The position of the tab bar is controlled using the
           \l{#tab-bar-sub}{::tab-bar} subcontrol.

           By default, the subcontrols have positions of a QTabWidget in
           the QWindowsStyle. To place the QTabBar in the center, set the
           subcontrol-position of the tab-bar subcontrol.

            The \l{#top-ps}{:top}, \l{#left-ps}{:left}, \l{#right-ps}{:right},

           \l{#alternate-background-color-prop}{alternate-background-color}
           property.

           The color and background of the selected item is styled using

           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color}
           respectively.

           The corner widget in a QTableView is implemented as a QAbstractButton
           and can be styled using the "QTableView QTableCornerButton::section"
           selector.

           \warning If you only set a background-color on a QTableCornerButton,
           the background may not appear unless you set the border property to
           some value. This is because, by default, the QTableCornerButton draws a
           native border which completely overlaps the background-color.

           The color of the grid can be specified using the
           \l{#gridline-color-prop}{gridline-color} property.

           See \l{qabstractscrollarea-widget}{QAbsractScrollArea} to

           of the tool bar within a line group (See
           QStyleOptionToolBar::positionWithinLine).

           The separator of a QToolBar is styled using the
           \l{#separator-sub}{::separator} subcontrol.

           The handle (to move the toolbar) is styled using the
           \l{#handle-sub}{::handle} subcontrol.

           If the QToolButton has a menu, is
           \l{#menu-indicator-sub}{::menu-indicator} subcontrol can be used to
           style the indicator. By default, the menu-indicator is positioned
           at the bottom right of the Padding rectangle of the widget.

           If the QToolButton is in QToolButton::MenuButtonPopup mode,
           the \l{#menu-button-sub}{::menu-button} subcontrol is used to draw the
           menu button. \l{#menu-arrow-sub}{::menu-arrow} subcontrol is used to
           draw the menu arrow inside the menu-button. By default, it is
           positioned in the center of the Contents rectangle of the
           menu-button subcontrol.

           When the QToolButton displays arrows, the \l{#up-arrow-sub}{::up-arrow},
           \l{#down-arrow-sub}{::down-arrow}, \l{#left-arrow-sub}{::left-arrow}
           and \l{#right-arrow-sub}{::right-arrow} subcontrols are used.

           \warning If you only set a background-color on a QToolButton, the background
           will not appear unless you set the border property to some value. This is
           because, by default, the QToolButton draws a native border which completely
           overlaps the background-color. For example,

           \l{QAbstractItemView::alternatingRowColors}{alternating row colors}
           is enabled, the alternating colors can be styled using the
           \l{#alternate-background-color-prop}{alternate-background-color}
           property.

           The color and background of the selected item is styled using
           \l{#selection-color-prop}{selection-color} and
           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color}
           respectively.

           The selection behavior is controlled by the
           \l{#show-decoration-selected-prop}{show-decoration-selected} property.

           The branches of the tree view can be styled using the
           \l{#branch-sub}{::branch} subcontrol. The
           ::branch Sub-control supports the \l{open-ps}{:open},

    \section1 List of Properties

    The table below lists all the properties supported by Qt Style
    Sheets. Which values can be given to an property depend on the
    \l{List of Property Types}{property's type}. Unless otherwise
    specified, properties below apply to all widgets. Properties
    marked with an asterisk * are specific to Qt and have no equivalent
    in CSS2 or CSS3.

        \li \b{\c alternate-background-color} \target alternate-background-color-prop
        \li \l{#Brush}{Brush} \br
        \li The \l{QAbstractItemView::alternatingRowColors}
           {alternate background color} used in QAbstractItemView subclasses.

           If this property is not set, the default value is
           whatever is set for the palette's
           \l{QPalette::}{AlternateBase} role.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 33

           See also \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-prop}{background} and
           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color}.

    \row
        \li \b{\c background} \target background-prop
        \li \l{#Background}{Background}
        \li Shorthand notation for setting the background. Equivalent
           to specifying \c background-color, \c background-image, \c
           background-repeat, and/or \c background-position.

           This property is supported by QAbstractItemView
           subclasses, QAbstractSpinBox subclasses, QCheckBox,
           QComboBox, QDialog, QFrame, QGroupBox, QLabel, QLineEdit,
           QMenu, QMenuBar, QPushButton, QRadioButton, QSplitter,
           QTextEdit, QToolTip, and plain \l{QWidget}s.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 34


           Often, it is required to set a fill pattern similar to the styles
           in Qt::BrushStyle. You can use the background-color property for
           Qt::SolidPattern, Qt::RadialGradientPattern, Qt::LinearGradientPattern
           and Qt::ConicalGradientPattern.  The other patterns are easily achieved
           by creating a background image that contains the pattern.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 35

           See also \l{#background-origin-prop}{background-origin},
           \l{#selection-background-color-prop}{selection-background-color},

        \li \c background-image \target background-image-prop
        \li \l{#Url}{Url}
        \li The background image used for the widget. Semi-transparent
           parts of the image let the \c background-color shine
           through.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 37

    \row
        \li \c background-repeat \target background-repeat-prop
        \li \l{#Repeat}{Repeat}
        \li Whether and how the background image is repeated to fill
           the \c background-origin rectangle.

           If this property is not specified, the background image
           is repeated in both directions (\c repeat).

           Example:

        \li \l{#Alignment}{Alignment}
        \li The alignment of the background image within the \c
           background-origin rectangle.

           If this property is not specified, the alignment is \c
           top \c left.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 39

    \row
        \li \b{\c background-attachment} \target background-attachment-prop
        \li \l{#Attachment}{Attachment}
        \li Determines whether the background-image in a QAbstractScrollArea
           is scrolled or fixed with respect to the viewport.
           By default, the background-image scrolls with the viewport.

           Example:

           and/or \c font-weight.

           This property is supported by all widgets that respect
           the \l QWidget::font.

           If this property is not set, the default is the
           QWidget::font.

        \li \l{#Color}{Color} \br
        \li The color of the grid line in a QTableView.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to the
           value specified by the current style for the
           \l{QStyle::}{SH_Table_GridLineColor} style hint.

        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The height of a subcontrol (or in some case, a widget).

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to a value
           that depends on the subcontrol/widget and on the current style.

           \warning Unless otherwise specified, this property has no effect
           when set on widgets. If you want a widget with a fixed height, set
           the \l{#min-width-prop}{min-height} and
           \l{#max-width-prop}{max-height} to the same value.

        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The width and height of the icon in a widget.

           The icon size of the following widgets can be set using this
           property.
               \list
               \li QCheckBox

        \li \b{\c image}* \target image-prop
        \li \l{#Url}{Url}+
        \li The image that is drawn in the contents rectangle of a
           subcontrol.

           The image property accepts a list of \l{#Url}{Url}s or
           an \c{svg}. The actual image that is drawn is determined
           using the same algorithm as QIcon (i.e) the image is never scaled
           up but always scaled down if necessary. If a \c{svg} is specified,
           the image is scaled to the size of the contents rectangle.

           Setting the image property on sub controls implicitly sets the
           width and height of the sub-control (unless the image in a SVG).

           In Qt 4.3 and later, the alignment of the
           image within the rectangle can be specified using
           \l{image-position-prop}{image-position}.

           This property is for subcontrols only--we don't support it for
           other elements.

           \warning The QIcon SVG plugin is needed to render SVG images.

    \row
        \li \b{\c image-position} \target image-position-prop
        \li \l{#Alignment}{alignment}
        \li In Qt 4.3 and later, the alignment of the image image's position can be specified
           using relative or absolute position.

    \row
        \li \b{\c left} \target left-prop
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c relative (the
           default), moves a subcontrol by a certain offset to
           the right.

           If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c absolute, the \c
           left property specifies the subcontrol's left edge in
           relation to the parent's left edge (see also
           \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}).

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to \c 0.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to the
           value specified by the current style for the
           \l{QStyle::}{SH_LineEdit_PasswordCharacter} style hint.

           margin-left.

           This property is supported by QAbstractItemView

           QMenuBar, QPushButton, QRadioButton, QSizeGrip, QSpinBox,
           QSplitter, QStatusBar, QTextEdit, and QToolTip.

           If this property is not specified, the minimum width is
           derived based on the widget's contents and the style.

           The value is relative to the contents rect in the \l{The
           Box Model}{box model}.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 67

    \row
        \li \b{\c opacity*} \target opacity-prop
        \li \l{#Number}{Number}
        \li The opacity for a widget. Possible values are from 0
           (transparent) to 255 (opaque). For the moment, this is
           only supported for \l{QToolTip}{tooltips}.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to the
           value specified by the current style for the
           \l{QStyle::}{SH_ToolTipLabel_Opacity} style hint.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 68

    \row
        \li \b{\c padding} \target padding-prop
        \li \l{#Box Lengths}{Box Lengths}
        \li The widget's padding. Equivalent to specifying \c
           padding-top, \c padding-right, \c padding-bottom, and \c
           padding-left.

           This property is supported by QAbstractItemView
           subclasses, QAbstractSpinBox subclasses, QCheckBox,
           QComboBox, QFrame, QGroupBox, QLabel, QLineEdit, QMenu,
           QMenuBar, QPushButton, QRadioButton, QSplitter, QTextEdit,
           and QToolTip.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to \c 0.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 69

           See also \l{#margin-prop}{margin},

        \li The widget's top padding.

    \row
        \li \c padding-right
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The widget's right padding.

    \row
        \li \c padding-bottom
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The widget's bottom padding.

    \row
        \li \c padding-left
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The widget's left padding.

    \row
        \li \b{\c paint-alternating-row-colors-for-empty-area}
            \target paint-alternating-row-colors-for-empty-area-prop
        \li \c bool
        \li Whether the QTreeView paints alternating row colors for the empty
           area (i.e the area where there are no items)

    \row
        \li \b{\c position} \target position-prop
        \li \c relative \br
           | \c absolute
        \li Whether offsets specified using \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#left-prop}{left},
           \l{#right-prop}{right}, \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#top-prop}{top}, and
           \l{#bottom-prop}{bottom} are relative or absolute
           coordinates.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to \c
           relative.

    \row
        \li \b{\c right} \target right-prop
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c relative (the
           default), moves a subcontrol by a certain offset to
           the left; specifying \tt{right: \e{x}} is then equivalent
           to specifying \tt{\l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#left-prop}{left}: -\e{x}}.

           If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c absolute, the \c
           right property specifies the subcontrol's right edge in
           relation to the parent's right edge (see also
           \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}).

        \li The background of selected text or items.

           This property is supported by all widgets that respect
           the \l QWidget::palette and that show selection text.

           If this property is not set, the default value is
           whatever is set for the palette's
           \l{QPalette::}{Highlight} role.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 71

    \row
        \li \b{\c selection-color*} \target selection-color-prop
        \li \l{#Brush}{Brush} \br
        \li The foreground of selected text or items.

           This property is supported by all widgets that respect
           the \l QWidget::palette and that show selection text.

           If this property is not set, the default value is
           whatever is set for the palette's
           \l{QPalette::}{HighlightedText} role.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 72

        \li \l{#Boolean}{Boolean}
        \li Controls whether selections in a QListView cover the
           entire row or just the extent of the text.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to the
           value specified by the current style for the
           \l{QStyle::}{SH_ItemView_ShowDecorationSelected} style
           hint.

           Example:

           This property is supported by QCheckBox, checkable
           \l{QGroupBox}es, QMenuBar, and QRadioButton.

           If this property is not specified, the default value
           depends on the widget and on the current style.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 74

           See also \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#padding-prop}{padding} and

    \row
        \li \b{\c subcontrol-origin*} \target subcontrol-origin-prop
        \li \l{#Origin}{Origin}
        \li The origin rectangle of the subcontrol within the
           parent element.

           If this property is not specified, the default is \c
           padding.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 75

           See also

        \li \b{\c subcontrol-position*} \target subcontrol-position-prop
        \li \l{#Alignment}{Alignment}
        \li The alignment of the subcontrol within the origin
           rectangle specified by \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}
           {subcontrol-origin}.

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to a value
           that depends on the subcontrol.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 76

           See also
           \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}.

    \row

        \li \l{#Alignment}{Alignment}
        \li The alignment of text and icon within the contents of the widget.

           If this value is not specified, it defaults to the value
           that depends on the native style.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 77

            This property is currently supported only by QPushButton
            and QProgressBar.

    \row
        \li \b{\c text-decoration}
        \li \c none \br

        \li Additional text effects

    \row
        \li \b{\c top} \target top-prop
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c relative (the
           default), moves a subcontrol by a certain offset
           down.

           If \l{#position-prop}{position} is \c absolute, the \c top
           property specifies the subcontrol's top edge in relation
           to the parent's top edge (see also
           \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin}).

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to \c 0.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 78

           See also \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#left-prop}{left}, \l{#right-prop}{right}, and
           \l{#bottom-prop}{bottom}.

    \row
        \li \b{\c width} \target width-prop
        \li \l{#Length}{Length}
        \li The width of a subcontrol (or a widget in some cases).

           If this property is not specified, it defaults to a value
           that depends on the subcontrol/widget and on the current style.

           \warning Unless otherwise specified, this property has no effect
           when set on widgets. If you want a widget with a fixed width, set
           the \l{#min-width-prop}{min-width} and
           \l{#max-width-prop}{max-width} to the same value.

           Example:

           \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 79

           respectively. If the left length is not specified, it is
           taken to be the same as the right length. If the bottom
           length is not specified, is it taken to be the same as the
           top length. If the right length is not specified, it is
           taken to be the same as the top length.

           \list
           \li \e{Linear} gradients interpolate colors between start and
              end points.
           \li \e{Radial} gradients interpolate colors between a focal
              point and end points on a circle surrounding it.
           \li \e{Conical} gradients interpolate colors around a center
              point.
           \endlist

        Gradients are specified in Object Bounding Mode. Imagine the box
        in which the gradient is rendered, to have its top left corner at (0, 0)
        and its bottom right corner at (1, 1). Gradient parameters are
        then specified as percentages from 0 to 1. These values are
        extrapolated to actual box coordinates at runtime. It is possible
        specify values that lie outside the bounding box (-0.6 or 1.8, for
        instance).

        \warning The stops have to appear sorted in ascending order.

           \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#illegalvalues}{ignore}
           a declaration with an illegal value. In Qt, it is mandatory to
           specify measurement units. For compatibility with earlier versions
           of Qt, numbers without measurement units are treated as pixels
           in most contexts. The supported units are:

           \list
           \li \c px: pixels
           \li \c pt: the size of one point (i.e., 1/72 of an inch)

        \li Indicates which of four rectangles to use.

           \list
           \li \c margin: The margin rectangle. The margin falls outside the border.
           \li \c border: The border rectangle. This is where any border is drawn.
           \li \c padding: The padding rectangle. Unlike the margins,
                          padding is located inside the border.
           \li \c content: The content rectangle. This specifies where
                          the actual contents go, excluding any

    \title Qt Style Sheets Examples

    We will now see a few examples to get started with using Qt Style Sheets.

    \tableofcontents
    \section1 Style Sheet Usage

    \section2 Customizing the Foreground and Background Colors

    Let's start by setting yellow as the background color of all
    \l{QLineEdit}s in an application. This could be achieved like
    this:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 88

    If we want the property to apply only to the \l{QLineEdit}s that are
    children (or grandchildren or grand-grandchildren) of a specific dialog,
    we would rather do this:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 89

    If we want the property to apply only to one specific QLineEdit,
    we can give it a name using QObject::setObjectName() and use an
    ID Selector to refer to it:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 90

    Alternatively, we can set the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-prop}{background-color} property directly on the
    QLineEdit, omitting the selector:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 91

    To ensure a good contrast, we should also specify a suitable
    color for the text:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 92

    It might be a good idea to change the colors used for selected
    text as well:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 93


    \section2 Customizing Using Dynamic Properties

    There are many situations where we need to present a form that
    has mandatory fields. To indicate to the user that the field is
    mandatory, one effective (albeit esthetically dubious) solution
    is to use yellow as the background color for those fields. It
    turns out this is very easy to implement using Qt Style Sheets.
    First, we would use the following application-wide style sheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 94

    This means that every widget whose \c mandatoryField Qt property
    is set to true would have a yellow background.

    Then, for each mandatory field widget, we would simply create a
    \c mandatoryField property on the fly and set it to true. For
    example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.cpp 95

    \section2 Customizing a QPushButton Using the Box Model

    This time, we will show how to create a red QPushButton. This
    QPushButton would presumably be connected to a very destructive
    piece of code.

    First, we are tempted to use this style sheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 96

    However, the result is a boring, flat button with no borders:

    \image stylesheet-redbutton1.png A flat red button

    What happened is this:

    \list
    \li We have made a request that cannot be satisfied using the
       native styles alone (e.g., the Windows XP theme engine doesn't
       let us specify the background color of a button).
    \li Therefore, the button is rendered using style sheets.
    \li We haven't specified any values for
       \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#border-width-prop}{border-width} and
       \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#border-style-prop}{border-style}, so by default we obtain
       a 0-pixel wide border of style \c none.
    \endlist

    Let's improve the situation by specifying a border:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 97

    \image stylesheet-redbutton2.png A red button with a beige border

    Things look already a lot better. But the button looks a bit
    cramped. Let's specify some spacing between the border and the
    text using the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#padding-prop}{padding}. Additionally, we will
    enforce a minimum width, round the corners, and specify a larger
    font to make the button look nicer:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 98

    \image stylesheet-redbutton3.png A red button with a round beige border and big, bold text

    The only issue remaining is that the button doesn't react when we
    press it. We can fix this by specifying a slightly different
    background color and use a different border style.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 99

    \section2 Customizing the QPushButton's Menu Indicator Sub-Control

    Subcontrols give access to the sub-elements of a widget. For
    example, a QPushButton associated with a menu (using
    QPushButton::setMenu()) has a menu indicator. Let's customize
    the menu indicator for the red push button:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 100

    By default, the menu indicator is located at the bottom-right
    corner of the padding rectangle. We can change this by specifying
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-position-prop}{subcontrol-position} and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin} to anchor the
    indicator differently. We can also use \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#top-prop}{top} and
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#left-prop}{left} to move the indicator by a few pixels. For
    example:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 101

    This positions the \c myindicator.png to the center right of the
    QPushButton's \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#padding-prop}{padding} rectangle (see
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#subcontrol-origin-prop}{subcontrol-origin} for more
    information).

    \section2 Complex Selector Example

    Since red seems to be our favorite color, let's make the text in
    QLineEdit red by setting the following application-wide
    stylesheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 102

    However, we would like to give a visual indication that a
    QLineEdit is read-only by making it appear gray:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 103

    At some point, our design team comes with the requirement that
    all \l{QLineEdit}s in the registration form (with the
    \l{QObject::objectName}{object name} \c registrationDialog) to be
    brown:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 104

    A few UI design meetings later, we decide that all our
    \l{QDialog}s should have brown colored \l{QLineEdit}s:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 105

    Quiz: What happens if we have a read-only QLineEdit in a QDialog?
    [Hint: The \l{The Style Sheet Syntax#Conflict Resolution}{Conflict Resolution} section above explains
    what happens in cases like this.]

    \section1 Customizing specific widgets

    This section provides examples to customize specific widgets using Style Sheets.

    \section2 Customizing QAbstractScrollArea

    The background of any QAbstractScrollArea (Item views, QTextEdit
    and QTextBrowser) can be set using the background properties. For example,
    to set a background-image that scrolls with the scroll bar:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 106

    If the background-image is to be fixed with the viewport:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 107

    \section2 Customizing QCheckBox

    Styling of a QCheckBox is almost identical to styling a QRadioButton. The
    main difference is that a tristate QCheckBox has an indeterminate state.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 108

    \section2 Customizing QComboBox

    We will look at an example where the drop down button of a QComboBox
    appears "merged" with the combo box frame.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 109

    The pop-up of the QComboBox is a QAbstractItemView and is styled using
    the descendant selector:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 110

    \section2 Customizing QDockWidget

    The title bar and the buttons of a QDockWidget can be customized as
    follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 111

    If one desires to move the dock widget buttons to the left, the following
    style sheet can be used:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 112

    \note To customize the separator (resize handle) of a QDockWidget,
    use QMainWindow::separator.

    \section2 Customizing QFrame

    A QFrame is styled using the \l{The Box Model}.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 113

    \section2 Customizing QGroupBox

    Let us look at an example that moves the QGroupBox's title to
    the center.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 114

    For a checkable QGroupBox, use the \{#indicator-sub}{::indicator} subcontrol
    and style it exactly like a QCheckBox (i.e)

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 115

    \section2 Customizing QHeaderView

    QHeaderView is customized as follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 116

    \section2 Customizing QLineEdit

    The frame of a QLineEdit is styled using the \l{The Box Model}. To
    create a line edit with rounded corners, we can set:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 117

    The password character of line edits that have QLineEdit::Password
    echo mode can be set using:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 118

    The background of a read only QLineEdit can be modified as below:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 119

    \section2 Customizing QListView

    The background color of alternating rows can be customized using the following
    style sheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 120

    To provide a special background when you hover over items, we can use the
    \l{item-sub}{::item} subcontrol. For example,

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 121

    \section2 Customizing QMainWindow

    The separator of a QMainWindow can be styled as follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 122

    \section2 Customizing QMenu

    Individual items of a QMenu are styled using the 'item' subcontrol as
    follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 123

    For a more advanced customization, use a style sheet as follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 124

    \section2 Customizing QMenuBar

    QMenuBar is styled as follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 125

    \section2 Customizing QProgressBar

    The QProgressBar's \l{stylesheet-reference.html#border-prop}{border},
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#chunk-sub}{chunk}, and
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#text-align-prop}{text-align} can be customized using
    style sheets. However, if one property or sub-control is customized,
    all the other properties or sub-controls must be customized as well.

    \image progressBar-stylesheet.png

    For example, we change the \l{stylesheet-reference.html#border-prop}
    {border} to grey and the \l{stylesheet-reference.html#chunk-sub}{chunk}
    to cerulean.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 126

    This leaves the \l{stylesheet-reference.html#text-align-prop}
    {text-align}, which we customize by positioning the text in the center of
    the progress bar.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 127

    A \l{stylesheet-reference.html#margin-prop}{margin} can be included to
    obtain more visible chunks.

    \image progressBar2-stylesheet.png

    In the screenshot above, we use a
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#margin-prop}{margin} of 0.5 pixels.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 128

    \section2 Customizing QPushButton

    A QPushButton is styled as follows:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 129

    For a QPushButton with a menu, use the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#menu-indicator-sub}{::menu-indicator}
    subcontrol.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 130

    Checkable QPushButton have the \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#checked-ps}
    {:checked} pseudo state set.

    \section2 Customizing QRadioButton

    The indicator of a QRadioButton can be changed using:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 131

    \section2 Customizing QScrollBar

    The QScrollBar can be styled using its subcontrols like
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#handle-sub}{handle},
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#add-line-sub}{add-line},
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#sub-line-sub}{sub-line}, and so on. Note that
    if one property or sub-control is customized, all the other properties or
    sub-controls must be customized as well.

    \image stylesheet-scrollbar1.png

    The scroll bar above has been styled in aquamarine with a solid grey
    border.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 132

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 133

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 134

    The \l{stylesheet-reference.html#left-arrow-sub}{left-arrow} and
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#right-arrow-sub}{right-arrow} have a solid grey
    border with a white background. As an alternative, you could also embed the
    image of an arrow.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 135

    If you want the scroll buttons of the scroll bar to be placed together
    (instead of the edges) like on Mac OS X, you can use the following
    stylesheet:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 136

    The scroll bar using the above stylesheet looks like this:
        \image stylesheet-scrollbar2.png


    To customize a vertical scroll bar use a style sheet similar to the following:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 137

    \section2 Customizing QSizeGrip

    QSizeGrip is usually styled by just setting an image.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 138

    \section2 Customizing QSlider

    You can style horizontal slider as below:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 139

    If you want to change the color of the slider parts before and after the handle, you can use the add-page
    and sub-page subcontrols. For example, for a vertical slider:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 140

    \section2 Customizing QSpinBox

    QSpinBox can be completely customized as below (the style sheet has commentary inline):

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 141


    \section2 Customizing QSplitter

    A QSplitter derives from a QFrame and hence can be styled like a QFrame.
    The grip or the handle is customized using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#handle-sub}{::handle} subcontrol.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 142

    \section2 Customizing QStatusBar

    We can provide a background for the status bar and a border for items
    inside the status bar as follows:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 143

    Note that widgets that have been added to the QStatusBar can be styled
    using the descendant declaration (i.e)
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 144

    \section2 Customizing QTabWidget and QTabBar

    \image tabWidget-stylesheet1.png

    For the screenshot above, we need a stylesheet as follows:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 145

    Often we require the tabs to overlap to look like below:
    \image tabWidget-stylesheet2.png

    For a tab widget that looks like above, we make use of
    \l{http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=B0029}
    {negative margins}. The resulting stylesheet looks like this:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 146

    To move the tab bar to the center (as below), we require the following stylesheet:
    \image tabWidget-stylesheet3.png

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 147

    The tear indicator and the scroll buttons can be further customized as follows:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 148

    Since Qt 4.6 the close button can be customized as follow:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 159

    \section2 Customizing QTableView

    Suppose we'd like our selected item in QTableView to have bubblegum pink
    fade to white as its background.

    \image tableWidget-stylesheet.png

    This is possible with the
    \l{stylesheet-reference.html#selection-background-color-prop}
    {selection-background-color} property and the syntax required is:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 149

    The corner widget can be customized using the following style sheet

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 150

    \section2 Customizing QToolBar

    The background and the handle of a QToolBar is customized as below:
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 151

    \section2 Customizing QToolBox

    The tabs of the QToolBox are customized using the 'tab' subcontrol.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 152

    \section2 Customizing QToolButton

    There are three types of QToolButtons.
    \list
       \li The QToolButton has no menu. In this case, the QToolButton is styled
          exactly like QPushButton.  See
          \l{#Customizing QPushButton}{Customizing QPushButton} for an
          example.

       \li The QToolButton has a menu and has the QToolButton::popupMode set to
          QToolButton::DelayedPopup or QToolButton::InstantPopup. In this case,
          the QToolButton is styled exactly like a QPushButton with a menu.
          See \l{#Customizing QPushButton}{Customizing QPushButton} for an
          example of the usage of the menu-indicator pseudo state.

        \li The QToolButton has its QToolButton::popupMode set to
           QToolButton::MenuButtonPopup. In this case, we style it as follows:
    \endlist

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 153


    \section2 Customizing QToolTip

    QToolTip is customized exactly like a QLabel. In addition, for platforms
    that support it, the opacity property may be set to adjust the opacity.

    For example,
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 154

    \section2 Customizing QTreeView

    The background color of alternating rows can be customized using the following
    style sheet:

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 155

    To provide a special background when you hover over items, we can use the
    \l{item-sub}{::item} subcontrol. For example,
    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 156

    The branches of a QTreeView are styled using the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#branch-sub}{::branch} subcontrol. The
    following stylesheet color codes the various states when drawing
    a branch.

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 157

    Colorful, though it is, a more useful example can be made using the
    following images:

    \table
    \row
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-vline.png
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-branch-more.png
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-branch-end.png
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-branch-closed.png
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-branch-open.png
    \row
    \li vline.png
    \li branch-more.png
    \li branch-end.png
    \li branch-closed.png
    \li branch-open.png
    \endtable

    \snippet code/doc_src_stylesheet.qdoc 158

    The resulting tree view looks like this:

    \image stylesheet-treeview.png

    \section1 Common mistakes

    This section lists some common mistakes when using stylesheets.

    \section2 QPushButton and images

    When styling a QPushButton, it is often desirable to use an image as the
    button graphic. It is common to try the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#background-image-prop}{background-image}
    property,
    but this has a number of drawbacks: For instance, the background will
    often appear hidden behind the button decoration, because it is not
    considered a background. In addition, if the button is resized, the
    entire background will be stretched or tiled, which does not
    always look good.

    It is better to use the
    \l{Qt Style Sheets Reference#border-image-prop}{border-image}
    property, as it will always display the image,
    regardless of the background (you can combine it with a background if it
    has alpha values in it), and it has special settings to deal with button
    resizing.

    Consider the following snippet:

    \snippet stylesheet/common-mistakes.cpp 1

    This will produce a button looking like this:

    \image stylesheet-border-image-normal.png

    The numbers after the url gives the top, right, bottom and left number of
    pixels, respectively. These numbers correspond to the border and should not
    stretch when the size changes.
    Whenever you resize the button, the middle part of the image will stretch
    in both directions, while the pixels specified in the stylesheet
    will not. This makes the borders of the button look more natural, like
    this:

    \table
    \row
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-border-image-stretched.png
    \row
    \li With borders
    \endtable

    \table
    \row
    \li \inlineimage stylesheet-border-image-wrong.png
    \row
    \li Without borders
    \endtable

    */
