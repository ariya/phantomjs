    \brief A guide to event handling in Qt.

    \ingroup frameworks-technologies

    In Qt, events are objects, derived from the abstract QEvent class,
    that represent things that have happened either within an application
    or as a result of outside activity that the application needs to know
    about. Events can be received and handled by any instance of a
    QObject subclass, but they are especially relevant to widgets. This
    document describes how events are delivered and handled in a typical
    application.

    \section1 How Events are Delivered

    When an event occurs, Qt creates an event object to represent it by
    constructing an instance of the appropriate QEvent subclass, and
    delivers it to a particular instance of QObject (or one of its
    subclasses) by calling its \l{QObject::}{event()} function.

    This function does not handle the event itself; based on the type
    of event delivered, it calls an event handler for that specific
    type of event, and sends a response based on whether the event
    was accepted or ignored.

    \omit
    Event delivery means that an
    event has occurred, the QEvent indicates precisely what, and the
    QObject needs to respond. Most events are specific to QWidget and its
    subclasses, but there are important events that aren't related to
    graphics (e.g., \l{QTimer}{timer events}).
    \endomit

    Some events, such as QMouseEvent and QKeyEvent, come from the
    window system; some, such as QTimerEvent, come from other sources;
    some come from the application itself.

    \section1 Event Types

    Most events types have special classes, notably QResizeEvent,
    QPaintEvent, QMouseEvent, QKeyEvent, and QCloseEvent. Each class
    subclasses QEvent and adds event-specific functions. For example,
    QResizeEvent adds \l{QResizeEvent::}{size()} and
    \l{QResizeEvent::}{oldSize()} to enable widgets to discover how
    their dimensions have been changed.

    Some classes support more than one actual event type. QMouseEvent
    supports mouse button presses, double-clicks, moves, and other
    related operations.

    Each event has an associated type, defined in QEvent::Type, and this
    can be used as a convenient source of run-time type information to
    quickly determine which subclass a given event object was constructed
    from.

    Since programs need to react in varied and complex ways, Qt's
    event delivery mechanisms are flexible. The documentation for
    QCoreApplication::notify() concisely tells the whole story; the
    \e{Qt Quarterly} article
    \l{http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq11-events.html}{Another Look at Events}
    rehashes it less concisely. Here we will explain enough for 95%
    of applications.

    \section1 Event Handlers

    The normal way for an event to be delivered is by calling a virtual
    function. For example, QPaintEvent is delivered by calling
    QWidget::paintEvent(). This virtual function is responsible for
    reacting appropriately, normally by repainting the widget. If you
    do not perform all the necessary work in your implementation of the
    virtual function, you may need to call the base class's implementation.

    For example, the following code handles left mouse button clicks on
    a custom checkbox widget while passing all other button clicks to the
    base QCheckBox class:

    \snippet events/events.cpp 0

    If you want to replace the base class's function, you must
    implement everything yourself. However, if you only want to extend
    the base class's functionality, then you implement what you want and
    call the base class to obtain the default behavior for any cases you
    do not want to handle.

    Occasionally, there isn't such an event-specific function, or the
    event-specific function isn't sufficient. The most common example
    involves Tab key presses. Normally, QWidget intercepts these to
    move the keyboard focus, but a few widgets need the Tab key for
    themselves.

    These objects can reimplement QObject::event(), the general event
    handler, and either do their event handling before or after the usual
    handling, or they can replace the function completely. A very unusual
    widget that both interprets Tab and has an application-specific
    custom event might contain the following \l{QObject::event()}{event()}
    function:

    \snippet events/events.cpp 1

    Note that QWidget::event() is still called for all of the cases not
    handled, and that the return value indicates whether an event was
    dealt with; a \c true value prevents the event from being sent on
    to other objects.

    \section1 Event Filters

    Sometimes an object needs to look at, and possibly intercept, the
    events that are delivered to another object. For example, dialogs
    commonly want to filter key presses for some widgets; for example,
    to modify Return-key handling.

    The QObject::installEventFilter() function enables this by setting
    up an \e{event filter}, causing a nominated filter object to receive
    the events for a target object in its QObject::eventFilter()
    function. An event filter gets to process events before the target
    object does, allowing it to inspect and discard the events as
    required. An existing event filter can be removed using the
    QObject::removeEventFilter() function.

    When the filter object's \l{QObject::}{eventFilter()} implementation
    is called, it can accept or reject the event, and allow or deny
    further processing of the event. If all the event filters allow
    further processing of an event (by each returning \c false), the event
    is sent to the target object itself. If one of them stops processing
    (by returning \c true), the target and any later event filters do not
    get to see the event at all.

    \snippet eventfilters/filterobject.cpp 0

    The above code shows another way to intercept Tab key press
    events sent to a particular target widget. In this case, the filter
    handles the relevant events and returns \c true to stop them from
    being processed any further. All other events are ignored, and the
    filter returns \c false to allow them to be sent on to the target
    widget, via any other event filters that are installed on it.

    It is also possible to filter \e all events for the entire application,
    by installing an event filter on the QApplication or QCoreApplication
    object. Such global event filters are called before the object-specific
    filters. This is very powerful, but it also slows down event delivery
    of every single event in the entire application; the other techniques
    discussed should generally be used instead.

    \section1 Sending Events

    Many applications want to create and send their own events. You can
    send events in exactly the same ways as Qt's own event loop by
    constructing suitable event objects and sending them with
    QCoreApplication::sendEvent() and QCoreApplication::postEvent().

    \l{QCoreApplication::}{sendEvent()} processes the event immediately.
    When it returns, the event filters and/or the object itself have
    already processed the event. For many event classes there is a function
    called isAccepted() that tells you whether the event was accepted
    or rejected by the last handler that was called.

    \l{QCoreApplication::}{postEvent()} posts the event on a queue for
    later dispatch. The next time Qt's main event loop runs, it dispatches
    all posted events, with some optimization. For example, if there are
    several resize events, they are compressed into one. The same
    applies to paint events: QWidget::update() calls
    \l{QCoreApplication::}{postEvent()}, which eliminates flickering and
    increases speed by avoiding multiple repaints.

    \l{QCoreApplication::}{postEvent()} is also used during object
    initialization, since the posted event will typically be dispatched
    very soon after the initialization of the object is complete.
    When implementing a widget, it is important to realize that events
    can be delivered very early in its lifetime so, in its constructor,
    be sure to initialize member variables early on, before there's any
    chance that it might receive an event.

    To create events of a custom type, you need to define an event
    number, which must be greater than QEvent::User, and you may need to
    subclass QEvent in order to pass specific information about your
    custom event. See the QEvent documentation for further details.
