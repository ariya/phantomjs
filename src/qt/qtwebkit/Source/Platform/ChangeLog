        Unreviewed GTK build fix.

        * GNUmakefile.am: Add the Freetype CFLAGS to the list of libPlatformGtk's CPPFLAGS. These are required as there are
        specific build targets that end up including the HarfBuzz headers which are included in the Freetype CFLAGS variable.

        CFLAGS to the list of libPlatform CPPFLAGS. Add GStreamer dependency's CFLAGS to the list of libPlatformGtk
        CPPFLAGS.

        [GTK] libPlatform, libPlatformGtk must depend on the related GNUmakefiles
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=115937

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        * GNUmakefile.am: Set up an artifical dependency so that libPlatform and libPlatformGtk
        libraries take into account any changes in this GNUmakefile.am and the GNUmakefile.list.am
        located under Source/WebCore. The latter is included due to all the build targets for the
        two libraries being listed there.

        [GTK] Set up libPlatform.la
        https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=114168

        Reviewed by Martin Robinson.

        * GNUmakefile.am: Set up the libPlatform.la static library to build the source files listed in platform_sources.
        As with the libPlatformGtk.la library, only the Source/WebCore/platform and its subdirectories are allowed to be
        searched for headers to include, providing a convenient way to detect any platform violations. These directories
        are listed in the platform_webcore_cppflags variable.
