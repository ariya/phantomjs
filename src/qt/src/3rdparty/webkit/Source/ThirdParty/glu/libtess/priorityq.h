 * for this purpose pqInsert returns a "handle" which is supplied
 * as the argument.
 *
 * An initial heap may be created efficiently by calling pqInsert
 * repeatedly, then calling pqInit.  In any case pqInit must be called
 * before any operations other than pqInsert are used.
 *
 * If the heap is empty, pqMinimum/pqExtractMin will return a NULL key.

/* Since we support deletion the data structure is a little more

 * active nodes are stored in the range 1..pq->size.  When the
 * heap exceeds its allocated size (pq->max), its size doubles.
 * The children of node i are nodes 2i and 2i+1.
 *
 * Each node stores an index into an array "handles".  Each handle
 * stores a key, plus a pointer back to the node which currently
 * represents that key (ie. nodes[handles[i].node].handle == i).
