 Empty leaves all features enabled. See doc/html/emb-features.html for choices.

 Note that disabling some features will produce a libqt that is not
 compatible with other libqt builds. Such modifications are only
 supported on Qt for Embedded Linux where reducing the library size is
 important and where the application suite is often a fixed set.
