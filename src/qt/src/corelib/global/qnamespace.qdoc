    \brief The Qt namespace contains miscellaneous identifiers
    used throughout the Qt library.
*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::Orientation

    This type is used to signify an object's orientation.

    \value Horizontal
    \value Vertical

    Orientation is used with QScrollBar for example.
*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::AlignmentFlag

    This enum type is used to describe alignment. It contains
    horizontal and vertical flags that can be combined to produce
    the required effect.

    The \l{TextElideMode} enum can also be used in many situations
    to fine-tune the appearance of aligned text.

    The horizontal flags are:

    \value AlignLeft Aligns with the left edge.
    \value AlignRight Aligns with the right edge.
    \value AlignHCenter Centers horizontally in the available space.
    \value AlignJustify Justifies the text in the available space.
    \omitvalue AlignAuto

    The vertical flags are:

    \value AlignTop Aligns with the top.
    \value AlignBottom Aligns with the bottom.
    \value AlignVCenter Centers vertically in the available space.

    You can use only one of the horizontal flags at a time. There is
    one two-dimensional flag:

    \value AlignCenter Centers in both dimensions.

    You can use at most one horizontal and one vertical flag at a
    time. Qt::AlignCenter counts as both horizontal and vertical.

    Three enum values are useful in applications that can be run in
    right-to-left mode:

    \value AlignAbsolute  If the widget's layout direction is
        Qt::RightToLeft (instead of Qt::LeftToRight, the default),
        Qt::AlignLeft refers to the \e right edge and Qt::AlignRight
        to the \e left edge. This is normally the desired behavior.
        If you want Qt::AlignLeft to always mean "left" and
        Qt::AlignRight to always mean "right", combine the flag with
        Qt::AlignAbsolute.
    \value AlignLeading  Synonym for Qt::AlignLeft.
    \value AlignTrailing  Synonym for Qt::AlignRight.

    Masks:

    \value AlignHorizontal_Mask
    \value AlignVertical_Mask

    Conflicting combinations of flags have undefined meanings.
*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::ApplicationAttribute

    This enum describes attributes that change the behavior of
    application-wide features. These are enabled and disabled using
    QCoreApplication::setAttribute(), and can be tested for with
    QCoreApplication::testAttribute().

    \value AA_ImmediateWidgetCreation Ensures that widgets are created
           as soon as they are constructed. By default, resources for
           widgets are allocated on demand to improve efficiency and
           minimize resource usage. Setting or clearing this attribute
           affects widgets constructed after the change. Setting it
           tells Qt to create toplevel windows immediately.
           Therefore, if it is important to minimize resource
           consumption, do not set this attribute.

    \value AA_MSWindowsUseDirect3DByDefault This value is obsolete and
           has no effect.

    \value AA_DontShowIconsInMenus Actions with the Icon property won't be
           shown in any menus unless specifically set by the
           QAction::iconVisibleInMenu property.
           Menus that are currently open or menus already created in the native
           Mac OS X menubar \e{may not} pick up a change in this attribute. Changes
           in the QAction::iconVisibleInMenu property will always be picked up.

    \value AA_NativeWindows Ensures that widgets have native windows.

    \value AA_DontCreateNativeWidgetSiblings Ensures that siblings of native
           widgets stay non-native unless specifically set by the
           Qt::WA_NativeWindow attribute.

    \value AA_MacPluginApplication Stops the Qt mac application from doing
           specific initializations that do not necessarily make sense when using Qt
           to author a plugin. This includes avoiding loading our nib for the main
           menu and not taking possession of the native menu bar. When setting this
           attribute to true will also set the AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar attribute
           to true.

    \value AA_DontUseNativeMenuBar All menubars created while this attribute is
           set to true won't be used as a native menubar (e.g, the menubar at
           the top of the main screen on Mac OS X or at the bottom in Windows CE).

    \value AA_MacDontSwapCtrlAndMeta On Mac OS X by default, Qt swaps the
           Control and Meta (Command) keys (i.e., whenever Control is pressed, Qt
           sends Meta, and whenever Meta is pressed Control is sent). When this
           attribute is true, Qt will not do the flip. QKeySequence::StandardShortcuts
           will also flip accordingly (i.e., QKeySequence::Copy will be
           Command+C on the keyboard regardless of the value set, though what is output for
           QKeySequence::toString(QKeySequence::PortableText) will be different).

    \value AA_S60DontConstructApplicationPanes Stops Qt from initializing the S60 status
           pane and softkey pane on Symbian. This is useful to save memory and reduce
           startup time for applications that will run in fullscreen mode during their
           whole lifetime. This attribute must be set before QApplication is
           constructed.

    \value AA_S60DisablePartialScreenInputMode By default in Symbian^3, a separate
           editing window is opened on top of an application. This is exactly like
           editing on previous versions of Symbian behave. When this attribute is false,
           a non-fullscreen virtual keyboard window is shown on top of application and
           it is ensured that the focused text input widget is visible.
           The auto-translation of input widget is only supported for applications
           based on QGraphicsView, but the non-fullscreen virtual keyboard will
           work for any kind of application (i.e. QWidgets-based). By default this
           attribute is true. This attribute must be set after QApplication is
           constructed. This is only supported in Symbian^3 and later Symbian releases.

    \value AA_X11InitThreads Calls XInitThreads() as part of the QApplication
           construction in order to make Xlib calls thread-safe. This
           attribute must be set before QApplication is constructed.

    \value AA_CaptureMultimediaKeys Enables application to receive multimedia key events
            (play, next, previous etc). This includes also external sources such as headsets.
            Application can not use Remote Control framework on Symbian if this attribute is 
            set. On Symbian, multimedia key event routing may vary between different devices. 
            For example, application on background may receive multimedia key events only if 
            it has active audio stream i.e. it is playing music or video. This attribute must 
            be set before QApplication is constructed. This attribute is only supported in Symbian 
            platform.

    \enum Qt::BGMode

    Background mode:

    \value TransparentMode

*/

/*!
    \enum Qt::ConnectionType

    This enum describes the types of connection that can be used
    between signals and slots. In particular, it determines whether a
    particular signal is delivered to a slot immediately or queued for
    delivery at a later time.

    \value AutoConnection
            (default) If the signal is emitted from a different thread than the
            receiving object, the signal is queued, behaving as
            Qt::QueuedConnection. Otherwise, the slot is invoked directly,
            behaving as Qt::DirectConnection. The type of connection is
            determined when the signal is emitted.

    \value DirectConnection
	   The slot is invoked immediately, when the signal is
       	   emitted.

    \value QueuedConnection
    	   The slot is invoked when control returns to the event loop
       	   of the receiver's thread. The slot is executed in the
       	   receiver's thread.

    \value BlockingQueuedConnection
           Same as QueuedConnection, except the current thread blocks
           until the slot returns. This connection type should only be
           used where the emitter and receiver are in different
           threads.  \note Violating this rule can cause your
           application to deadlock.

    \value UniqueConnection
           Same as AutoConnection, but the connection is made only if
    	   it does not duplicate an existing connection. i.e., if the
    	   same signal is already connected to the same slot for the
    	   same pair of objects, then the connection will fail. This
    	   connection type was introduced in Qt 4.6.

    \value AutoCompatConnection
    	   The default type when Qt 3 support is enabled. Same as
	   AutoConnection but will also cause warnings to be output in
	   certain situations. See \l{Porting to Qt 4#Compatibility
	   Signals and Slots}{Compatibility Signals and Slots} for
	   further information.

    With queued connections, the parameters must be of types that are
    known to Qt's meta-object system, because Qt needs to copy the
    arguments to store them in an event behind the scenes. If you try
    to use a queued connection and get the error message:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/doc_src_qnamespace.qdoc 0

    Call qRegisterMetaType() to register the data type before you
    establish the connection.

    When using signals and slots with multiple threads, see \l{Signals and Slots Across Threads}.

/*!
    \enum Qt::DateFormat

    \value TextDate The default Qt format, which includes the day and month name,
    the day number in the month, and the year in full. The day and month names will

    string, "ddd MMM d yyyy". See QDate::toString() for more information.

    \value ISODate \l{ISO 8601} extended format: either \c{YYYY-MM-DD} for dates or
    \c{YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss}, \c{YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssTZD} (e.g., 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
    for combined dates and times.

    \value SystemLocaleLongDate The \l{QLocale::LongFormat}{long format} used
    by the \l{QLocale::system()}{operating system}.

    \value DefaultLocaleShortDate The \l{QLocale::ShortFormat}{short format} specified
    by the \l{QLocale::setDefault()}{application's locale}.

    \value DefaultLocaleLongDate The \l{QLocale::LongFormat}{long format} used
    by the \l{QLocale::setDefault()}{application's locale}.

    \value SystemLocaleDate \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use Qt::SystemLocaleShortDate
    instead (or Qt::SystemLocaleLongDate if you want long dates).

    \value LocaleDate \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use Qt::DefaultLocaleShortDate
    instead (or Qt::DefaultLocaleLongDate if you want long dates).

    \value LocalDate \e{This enum value is deprecated.} Use Qt::SystemLocaleShortDate

    \note For \c ISODate formats, each \c Y, \c M and \c D represents a single digit
    of the year, month and day used to specify the date. Each \c H, \c M and \c S
    represents a single digit of the hour, minute and second used to specify the time.
    The presence of a literal \c T character is used to separate the date and time when
    both are specified.

    \enum Qt::ImageConversionFlag

    The options marked "(default)" are set if no other values from
    the list are included (since the defaults are zero):

    Color/Mono preference (ignored for QBitmap):

    \value AutoColor (default) - If the image has \link
           QImage::depth() depth\endlink 1 and contains only
           black and white pixels, the pixmap becomes monochrome.
    \value ColorOnly The pixmap is dithered/converted to the
           \link QPixmap::defaultDepth() native display depth\endlink.
    \value MonoOnly The pixmap becomes monochrome. If necessary,
           it is dithered using the chosen dithering algorithm.

    Dithering mode preference for RGB channels:

    \value DiffuseDither (default) - A high-quality dither.
    \value OrderedDither A faster, more ordered dither.
    \value ThresholdDither No dithering; closest color is used.

    Dithering mode preference for alpha channel:

    \value ThresholdAlphaDither (default) - No dithering.
    \value OrderedAlphaDither A faster, more ordered dither.
    \value DiffuseAlphaDither A high-quality dither.
    \omitvalue NoAlpha

    Color matching versus dithering preference:

    \value PreferDither (default when converting to a pixmap) - Always dither
           32-bit images when the image is converted to 8 bits.
    \value AvoidDither (default when converting for the purpose of saving to
           file) - Dither 32-bit images only if the image has more than 256
           colors and it is being converted to 8 bits.
    \omitvalue AutoDither

    \omitvalue ColorMode_Mask
    \omitvalue Dither_Mask
    \omitvalue AlphaDither_Mask
    \omitvalue DitherMode_Mask

    \value NoOpaqueDetection Do not check whether the image contains non-opaque
           pixels. Use this if you know that the image is semi-transparent and
           you want to avoid the overhead of checking the pixels in the image
           until a non-opaque pixel is found, or if you want the pixmap to
           retain an alpha channel for some other reason. If the image has no
           alpha channel this flag has no effect.

    \omitvalue NoFormatConversion Don't do any format conversions on the image.
           Can be useful when converting a QImage to a QPixmap for a one-time
           rendering operation for example.

/*!
    \enum Qt::WidgetAttribute

    \keyword widget attributes

    This enum type is used to specify various widget attributes.
    Attributes are set and cleared with QWidget::setAttribute(), and
    queried with QWidget::testAttribute(), although some have special
    convenience functions which are mentioned below.

    \value WA_AcceptDrops Allows data from drag and drop operations
    to be dropped onto the widget (see QWidget::setAcceptDrops()).

    \value WA_AlwaysShowToolTips Enables tooltips for inactive windows.

    \value WA_ContentsPropagated This flag is superfluous and
    obsolete; it no longer has any effect. Since Qt 4.1, all widgets
    that do not set WA_PaintOnScreen propagate their contents.

    \value WA_CustomWhatsThis Indicates that the widget wants to
    continue operating normally in "What's This?" mode. This is set by the
    widget's author.

    \value WA_DeleteOnClose Makes Qt delete this widget when the
    widget has accepted the close event (see QWidget::closeEvent()).

    \value WA_Disabled Indicates that the widget is disabled, i.e.
    it does not receive any mouse or keyboard events. There is also a
    getter functions QWidget::isEnabled().  This is set/cleared by the
    Qt kernel.

    \value WA_DontShowOnScreen Indicates that the widget is hidden or is
    not a part of the viewable Desktop.

    \omitvalue WA_DropSiteRegistered
    \omitvalue WA_ForceAcceptDrops

    \value WA_ForceDisabled Indicates that the widget is
    explicitly disabled, i.e. it will remain disabled even when all
    its ancestors are set to the enabled state. This implies
    WA_Disabled. This is set/cleared by QWidget::setEnabled() and
    QWidget::setDisabled().

    \value WA_ForceUpdatesDisabled Indicates that updates are
    explicitly disabled for the widget; i.e. it will remain disabled
    even when all its ancestors are set to the updates-enabled state.
    This implies WA_UpdatesDisabled. This is set/cleared by
    QWidget::setUpdatesEnabled().

    \value WA_GroupLeader
        \e{This attribute has been deprecated.} Use QWidget::windowModality
        instead.

    \value WA_Hover Forces Qt to generate paint events when the mouse
    enters or leaves the widget. This feature is typically used when
    implementing custom styles; see the \l{widgets/styles}{Styles}
    example for details.

    \value WA_InputMethodEnabled Enables input methods for Asian languages.
    Must be set when creating custom text editing widgets.
    On Windows CE and Symbian this flag can be used in addition to
    QApplication::autoSipEnabled to automatically display the SIP when
    entering a widget.

    \value WA_KeyboardFocusChange Set on a toplevel window when
    the users changes focus with the keyboard (tab, backtab, or shortcut).

    \value WA_KeyCompression Enables key event compression if set,
    and disables it if not set. By default key compression is off, so
    widgets receive one key press event for each key press (or more,
    since autorepeat is usually on). If you turn it on and your
    program doesn't keep up with key input, Qt may try to compress key
    events so that more than one character can be processed in each
    event.
    For example, a word processor widget might receive 2, 3 or more
    characters in each QKeyEvent::text(), if the layout recalculation
    takes too long for the CPU.
    If a widget supports multiple character unicode input, it is
    always safe to turn the compression on.
    Qt performs key event compression only for printable characters.
    Qt::Modifier keys, cursor movement keys, function keys and
    miscellaneous action keys (e.g. Escape, Enter, Backspace,
    PrintScreen) will stop key event compression, even if there are
    more compressible key events available.
    Platforms other than Mac and X11 do not support this compression,
    in which case turning it on will have no effect.
    This is set/cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_LayoutOnEntireRect Indicates that the widget
    wants QLayout to operate on the entire QWidget::rect(), not only
    on QWidget::contentsRect(). This is set by the widget's author.

    \value WA_LayoutUsesWidgetRect Ignore the layout item rect from the style
    when laying out this widget with QLayout. This makes a difference in
    QMacStyle and QPlastiqueStyle for some widgets.

    \value WA_MacNoClickThrough When a widget that has this attribute set
    is clicked, and its window is inactive, the click will make the window
    active but won't be seen by the widget. Typical use of this attribute
    is on widgets with "destructive" actions, such as a "Delete" button.
    WA_MacNoClickThrough also applies to all child widgets of the widget
    that has it set.

    \value WA_MacOpaqueSizeGrip Indicates that the native Carbon size grip
    should be opaque instead of transparent (the default). This attribute
    is only applicable to Mac OS X and is set by the widget's author.

    \value WA_MacShowFocusRect Indicates that this widget should get a
    QFocusFrame around it. Some widgets draw their own focus halo
    regardless of this attribute. Not that the QWidget::focusPolicy
    also plays the main role in whether something is given focus or
    not, this only controls whether or not this gets the focus
    frame. This attribute is only applicable to Mac OS X.

    \value WA_MacNormalSize Indicates the widget should have the
    normal size for widgets in Mac OS X. This attribute is only
    applicable to Mac OS X.

    \value WA_MacSmallSize Indicates the widget should have the small
    size for widgets in Mac OS X. This attribute is only applicable to
    Mac OS X.

    \value WA_MacMiniSize Indicates the widget should have the mini
    size for widgets in Mac OS X. This attribute is only applicable to
    Mac OS X.

    \value WA_MacVariableSize Indicates the widget can choose between
    alternative sizes for widgets to avoid clipping.
    This attribute is only applicable to Mac OS X.

    \value WA_MacBrushedMetal Indicates the widget should be drawn in
    the brushed metal style as supported by the windowing system. This
    attribute is only applicable to Mac OS X.

    \omitvalue WA_MacMetalStyle

    \value WA_Mapped Indicates that the widget is mapped on screen.
    This is set/cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_MouseNoMask Makes the widget receive mouse events for
    the entire widget regardless of the currently set mask,
    overriding QWidget::setMask(). This is not applicable for
    top-level windows.

    \value WA_MouseTracking Indicates that the widget has mouse
    tracking enabled. See QWidget::mouseTracking.

    \value WA_Moved Indicates that the widget has an explicit
    position. This is set/cleared by QWidget::move() and
    by QWidget::setGeometry().

    \value WA_MSWindowsUseDirect3D This value is obsolete and has no
    effect.

    \value WA_NoBackground This value is obsolete. Use
    WA_OpaquePaintEvent instead.

    \value WA_NoChildEventsForParent Indicates that the widget does
    not want ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent to its
    parent. This is rarely necessary but can help to avoid automatic
    insertion widgets like splitters and layouts. This is set by a
    widget's author.

    \value WA_NoChildEventsFromChildren Indicates that the widget does
    not want to receive ChildAdded or ChildRemoved events sent from its
    children. This is set by a widget's author.

    \value WA_NoMouseReplay Used for pop-up widgets. Indicates that the most
    recent mouse press event should not be replayed when the pop-up widget
    closes. The flag is set by the widget's author and cleared by the Qt kernel
    every time the widget receives a new mouse event.

    \value WA_NoMousePropagation Prohibits mouse events from being propagated
    to the widget's parent. This attribute is disabled by default.

    \value WA_TransparentForMouseEvents When enabled, this attribute disables
    the delivery of mouse events to the widget and its children. Mouse events
    are delivered to other widgets as if the widget and its children were not
    present in the widget hierarchy; mouse clicks and other events effectively
    "pass through" them. This attribute is disabled by default.

    \value WA_NoSystemBackground Indicates that the widget has no background,
    i.e. when the widget receives paint events, the background is not
    automatically repainted. \note Unlike WA_OpaquePaintEvent, newly exposed
    areas are \bold never filled with the background (e.g., after showing a
    window for the first time the user can see "through" it until the
    application processes the paint events). This flag is set or cleared by the
    widget's author.

    \value WA_OpaquePaintEvent Indicates that the widget paints all its pixels
    when it receives a paint event. Thus, it is not required for operations
    like updating, resizing, scrolling and focus changes to erase the widget
    before generating paint events. The use of WA_OpaquePaintEvent provides a
    small optimization by helping to reduce flicker on systems that do not
    support double buffering and avoiding computational cycles necessary to
    erase the background prior to painting. \note Unlike
    WA_NoSystemBackground, WA_OpaquePaintEvent makes an effort to avoid
    transparent window backgrounds. This flag is set or cleared by the widget's
    author.

    \value WA_OutsideWSRange Indicates that the widget is outside
    the valid range of the window system's coordinate system. A widget
    outside the valid range cannot be mapped on screen. This is
    set/cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_PaintOnScreen Indicates that the widget wants to draw directly
    onto the screen. Widgets with this attribute set do not participate in
    composition management, i.e. they cannot be semi-transparent or shine
    through semi-transparent overlapping widgets. \note This flag is only
    supported on X11 and it disables double buffering. On Qt for Embedded
    Linux, the flag only works when set on a top-level widget and it relies on
    support from the active screen driver. This flag is set or cleared by the
    widget's author. To render outside of Qt's paint system, e.g., if you
    require native painting primitives, you need to reimplement
    QWidget::paintEngine() to return 0 and set this flag.

    \value WA_PaintOutsidePaintEvent Makes it possible to use QPainter to
    paint on the widget outside \l{QWidget::paintEvent()}{paintEvent()}. This
    flag is not supported on Windows, Mac OS X or Embedded Linux. We recommend
    that you use it only when porting Qt 3 code to Qt 4.

    \value WA_PaintUnclipped Makes all painters operating on this widget
    unclipped. Children of this widget or other widgets in front of it do not
    clip the area the painter can paint on. This flag is only supported for
    widgets with the WA_PaintOnScreen flag set. The preferred way to do this in
    a cross platform way is to create a transparent widget that lies in front
    of the other widgets.

    \value WA_PendingMoveEvent Indicates that a move event is pending, e.g.,
    when a hidden widget was moved. This flag is set or cleared by the Qt
    kernel.

    \value WA_PendingResizeEvent Indicates that a resize event is pending,
    e.g., when a hidden widget was resized. This flag is set or cleared by the
    Qt kernel.

    \value WA_QuitOnClose Makes Qt quit the application when the last widget
    with the attribute set has accepted closeEvent(). This behavior can be
    modified with the QApplication::quitOnLastWindowClosed property. By default
    this attribute is set for all widgets of type Qt::Window.

    \value WA_Resized Indicates that the widget has an explicit size. This flag
    is set or cleared by QWidget::resize() and QWidget::setGeometry().

    \value WA_RightToLeft Indicates that the layout direction for the widget
    is right to left.

    \value WA_SetCursor Indicates that the widget has a cursor of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setCursor() and QWidget::unsetCursor().

    \value WA_SetFont Indicates that the widget has a font of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setFont().

    \value WA_SetPalette Indicates that the widget has a palette of its own.
    This flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setPalette().

    \value WA_SetStyle Indicates that the widget has a style of its own. This
    flag is set or cleared by QWidget::setStyle().

    \value WA_ShowModal \e{This attribute has been deprecated.} Use
    QWidget::windowModality instead.

    \value WA_StaticContents Indicates that the widget contents are north-west
    aligned and static. On resize, such a widget will receive paint events only
    for parts of itself that are newly visible. This flag is set or cleared by
    the widget's author.

    \value WA_StyleSheet Indicates that the widget is styled using a
    \l{Qt Style Sheets}{style sheet}.

    \value WA_TranslucentBackground Indicates that the widget should have a
    translucent background, i.e., any non-opaque regions of the widgets will be
    translucent because the widget will have an alpha channel. Setting this
    flag causes WA_NoSystemBackground to be set. On Windows the
    widget also needs the Qt::FramelessWindowHint window flag to be set.
    This flag is set or cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_UnderMouse Indicates that the widget is under the mouse cursor.
    The value is not updated correctly during drag and drop operations. There
    is also a getter function, QWidget::underMouse(). This flag is set or
    cleared by the Qt kernel.

    \value WA_UpdatesDisabled Indicates that updates are blocked (including the
    system background). This flag is set or cleared by the Qt kernel.
    \warning This flag must \e never be set or cleared by the widget's author.

    \value WA_WindowModified Indicates that the window is marked as modified.
    On some platforms this flag will do nothing, on others (including Mac OS X
    and Windows) the window will take a modified appearance. This flag is set
    or cleared by QWidget::setWindowModified().

    \value WA_WindowPropagation Makes a toplevel window inherit font and
    palette from its parent.

    \value WA_MacAlwaysShowToolWindow On Mac OS X, show the tool window even
    when the application is not active.  By default, all tool windows are
    hidden when the application is inactive.

    \value WA_SetLocale Indicates the locale should be taken into consideration
    in the widget.

    \value WA_StyledBackground Indicates the widget should be drawn using a
    styled background.

    \value WA_ShowWithoutActivating Show the widget without making it active.

    \value WA_NativeWindow Indicates that a native window is created for the
    widget. Enabling this flag will also force a native window for the widget's
    ancestors unless Qt::WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors is set.

    \value WA_DontCreateNativeAncestors Indicates that the widget's ancestors
    are kept non-native even though the widget itself is native.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDesktop Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDock Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK to the

    attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \note Qt
    automatically sets this attribute for QMenus added to a QMenuBar.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypePopupMenu Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_POPUP_MENU
    to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \note Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for QMenu.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeToolTip Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLTIP to the
    window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \note Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for the Qt::ToolTip window type.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeNotification Adds

    window property. See http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more
    details. This attribute has no effect on non-X11 platforms.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeCombo Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_COMBO
    to the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \note Qt automatically sets this
    attribute for the QComboBox pop-up.

    \value WA_X11NetWmWindowTypeDND Adds _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DND to
    the window's _NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE X11 window property. See
    http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/ for more details. This attribute
    has no effect on non-X11 platforms. \note Qt automatically sets this
    attribute on the feedback widget used during a drag.

    \value WA_MacFrameworkScaled Enables resolution independence aware mode
    on Mac when using Carbon. This attribute has no effect on Cocoa.
    The attribute is off by default and can be enabled on a per-window basis.

    \value WA_AcceptTouchEvents Allows touch events (see QTouchEvent)
    to be sent to the widget. Must be set on all widgets that can
    handle touch events. Without this attribute set, events from a
    touch device will be sent as mouse events.

    \value WA_TouchPadAcceptSingleTouchEvents Allows touchpad single
    touch events to be sent to the widget.

    \value WA_MergeSoftkeys Allows widget to merge softkeys with parent widget,
    i.e. widget can set only one softkeys and request softkey implementation
    to take rest of the softkeys from the parent. Note parents are traversed until
    WA_MergeSoftkeys is not set. See also Qt::WA_MergeSoftkeysRecursively
    This attribute currently has effect only on Symbian platforms

    \value WA_MergeSoftkeysRecursively Allows widget to merge softkeys recursively
    with all parents. If this attribute is set, the widget parents are traversed until
    window boundary (widget without parent or dialog) is found.
    This attribute currently has effect only on Symbian platforms

    \value WA_X11DoNotAcceptFocus Asks the window manager to not give focus
    to this top level window. This attribute has no effect on non-X11

/*!
    \enum Qt::WindowType

    \keyword window flag

    This enum type is used to specify various window-system properties
    for the widget. They are fairly unusual but necessary in a few
    cases. Some of these flags depend on whether the underlying window
    manager supports them.

    The main types are

    \value Widget  This is the default type for QWidget. Widgets of
                   this type are child widgets if they have a parent,
                   and independent windows if they have no parent.
                   See also Qt::Window and Qt::SubWindow.

    \value Window  Indicates that the widget is a window, usually
                   with a window system frame and a title bar,
                   irrespective of whether the widget has a parent or
                   not. Note that it is not possible to unset this
                   flag if the widget does not have a parent.

    \value Dialog  Indicates that the widget is a window that should
                   be decorated as a dialog (i.e., typically no
                   maximize or minimize buttons in the title bar).
                   This is the default type for QDialog. If you want
                   to use it as a modal dialog, it should be launched
                   from another window, or have a parent and used
                   with the QWidget::windowModality property. If you make
                   it modal, the dialog will prevent other top-level
                   windows in the application from getting any input.
                   We refer to a top-level window that has a parent
                   as a \e secondary window.

    \value Sheet   Indicates that the window is a Macintosh sheet. Since
                   using a sheet implies window modality, the recommended
                   way is to use QWidget::setWindowModality(), or
                   QDialog::open(), instead.

    \value Drawer  Indicates that the widget is a Macintosh drawer.

    \value Popup   Indicates that the widget is a pop-up top-level
                   window, i.e. that it is modal, but has a window
                   system frame appropriate for pop-up menus.

    \value Tool    Indicates that the widget is a tool window. A tool
                   window is often a small window with a smaller than
                   usual title bar and decoration, typically used for
                   collections of tool buttons. If there is a parent,
                   the tool window will always be kept on top of it.
                   If there isn't a parent, you may consider using
                   Qt::WindowStaysOnTopHint as well. If the window
                   system supports it, a tool window can be decorated
                   with a somewhat lighter frame. It can also be
                   combined with Qt::FramelessWindowHint.
                   \br
                   \br
                   On Mac OS X, tool windows correspond to the
                   \l{http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/HandlingWindowsControls/hitb-wind_cont_concept/chapter_2_section_2.html}{Floating}
                   class of windows. This means that the window lives on a
                   level above normal windows; it impossible to put a normal
                   window on top of it. By default, tool windows will disappear
                   when the application is inactive.  This can be controlled by
                   the Qt::WA_MacAlwaysShowToolWindow attribute.

    \value ToolTip Indicates that the widget is a tooltip. This is
                   used internally to implement
                   \l{QWidget::toolTip}{tooltips}.

    \value SplashScreen Indicates that the window is a splash screen.
                        This is the default type for QSplashScreen.

    \value Desktop  Indicates that this widget is the desktop. This
                    is the type for QDesktopWidget.

    \value SubWindow  Indicates that this widget is a sub-window, such
                      as a QMdiSubWindow widget.

    There are also a number of flags which you can use to customize
    the appearance of top-level windows. These have no effect on other
    windows:

    \value MSWindowsFixedSizeDialogHint  Gives the window a thin dialog border on Windows.
           This style is traditionally used for fixed-size dialogs.

    \value MSWindowsOwnDC  Gives the window its own display
           context on Windows.

    \value X11BypassWindowManagerHint  Bypass the window
           manager completely. This results in a borderless window
           that is not managed at all (i.e., no keyboard input unless
           you call QWidget::activateWindow() manually).

    \value FramelessWindowHint  Produces a borderless window.
           The user cannot move or resize a borderless window via the window
           system. On X11, the result of the flag is dependent on the window manager and its
           ability to understand Motif and/or NETWM hints. Most existing
           modern window managers can handle this.

    The \c CustomizeWindowHint flag is used to enable customization of
    the window controls. This flag must be set to allow the \c
    WindowTitleHint, \c WindowSystemMenuHint, \c
    WindowMinimizeButtonHint, \c WindowMaximizeButtonHint and \c
    WindowCloseButtonHint flags to be changed.

    \value CustomizeWindowHint  Turns off the default window title hints.

    \value WindowTitleHint  Gives the window a title bar.

    \value WindowSystemMenuHint Adds a window system menu, and
    possibly a close button (for example on Mac). If you need to hide
    or show a close button, it is more portable to use \c
    WindowCloseButtonHint.

    \value WindowMinimizeButtonHint  Adds a minimize button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowMaximizeButtonHint  Adds a maximize button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowMinMaxButtonsHint  Adds a minimize and a maximize
           button. On some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value WindowCloseButtonHint  Adds a close button. On
           some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it
           to work.

    \value WindowContextHelpButtonHint  Adds a context help button to dialogs.
           On some platforms this implies Qt::WindowSystemMenuHint for it to work.

    \value MacWindowToolBarButtonHint On Mac OS X adds a tool bar button (i.e.,
           the oblong button that is on the top right of windows that have toolbars).

    \value BypassGraphicsProxyWidget Prevents the window and its children from
           automatically embedding themselves into a QGraphicsProxyWidget if the
           parent widget is already embedded. You can set this flag if you
           want your widget to always be a toplevel widget on the desktop,
           regardless of whether the parent widget is embedded in a scene or
           not.

    \value WindowShadeButtonHint

    \value WindowStaysOnTopHint  Informs the window system that the
           window should stay on top of all other windows. Note that
           on some window managers on X11 you also have to pass
           Qt::X11BypassWindowManagerHint for this flag to work
           correctly.

    \value WindowStaysOnBottomHint Informs the window system that the
           window should stay on bottom of all other windows. Note
           that on X11 this hint will work only in window managers
           that support _NET_WM_STATE_BELOW atom. If a window always
           on the bottom has a parent, the parent will also be left on
           the bottom.  This window hint is currently not implemented
           for Mac OS X.

    \value WindowOkButtonHint Adds an OK button to the window decoration of a dialog.
           Only supported for Windows CE.

    \value WindowCancelButtonHint Adds a Cancel button to the window decoration of a dialog.
           Only supported for Windows CE.

    \value WindowSoftkeysVisibleHint Makes softkeys visible when widget is fullscreen.
           Only supported for Symbian.

    \value WindowSoftkeysRespondHint Makes softkeys to receive key events even
           when invisible. With this hint the softkey actions are triggered
           even the softkeys are invisible i.e. the window is displayed with
           \c showFullscreen(). Only supported for Symbian.

    \value WindowType_Mask  A mask for extracting the window type
                            part of the window flags.

    \value WMouseNoMask         Use Qt::WA_MouseNoMask instead.

    user-defined gesture ID.
    \omitvalue LastGestureType

    User-defined gestures are registered with the
    QGestureRecognizer::registerRecognizer() function which generates a custom
    gesture ID with the Qt::CustomGesture flag set.

/*!
    \enum Qt::GestureFlag
    \since 4.6

    This enum type describes additional flags that can be used when subscribing
    to a gesture.

    \value DontStartGestureOnChildren By default gestures can start on the
    widget or over any of its children. Use this flag to disable this and allow
    a gesture to start on the widget only.

    \value ReceivePartialGestures Allows any ignored gesture events to be
    propagated to parent widgets which have specified this hint. By default
    only gestures that are in the Qt::GestureStarted state are propagated and
    the widget always gets the full gesture sequence starting with a gesture in
    the Qt::GestureStarted state and ending with a gesture in the
    Qt::GestureFinished or Qt::GestureCanceled states.

    \value IgnoredGesturesPropagateToParent Since Qt 4.7, this flag allows you
    to fine-tune gesture event propagation. By setting the flag when
    \l{QGraphicsObject::grabGesture()}{grabbing} a gesture all ignored partial
    gestures will propagate to their parent items.

/*!
    \enum Qt::NavigationMode
    \since 4.6

    This enum type describes the mode for moving focus.

    \value NavigationModeNone                Only the touch screen is used.
    \value NavigationModeKeypadTabOrder      Qt::Key_Up and Qt::Key_Down are used to change focus.
    \value NavigationModeKeypadDirectional   Qt::Key_Up, Qt::Key_Down, Qt::Key_Left and Qt::Key_Right are used to change focus.
    \value NavigationModeCursorAuto          The mouse cursor is used to change focus,
                                             it is displayed only on non touchscreen devices.
                                             The keypad is used to implement a virtual cursor, unless
                                             the device has an analog mouse type of input device (e.g. touchpad).
                                             This is the recommended setting for an application such as a web browser that
                                             needs pointer control on both touch and non-touch devices.
    \value NavigationModeCursorForceVisible  The mouse cursor is used to change focus,
                                             it is displayed regardless of device type.
                                             The keypad is used to implement a virtual cursor, unless
                                             the device has an analog mouse type of input device (e.g. touchpad)

    \note: in 4.6, cursor navigation is only implemented for Symbian OS.
           On other platforms, it behaves as NavigationModeNone.
