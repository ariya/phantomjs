  \class QFinalState

  \brief The QFinalState class provides a final state.

  \since 4.6
  \ingroup statemachine

  A final state is used to communicate that (part of) a QStateMachine has
  finished its work. When a final top-level state is entered, the state
  machine's \l{QStateMachine::finished()}{finished}() signal is emitted. In
  general, when a final substate (a child of a QState) is entered, the parent
  state's \l{QState::finished()}{finished}() signal is emitted.  QFinalState
  is part of \l{The State Machine Framework}.

  To use a final state, you create a QFinalState object and add a transition
  to it from another state. Example:

  \code
  QPushButton button;

  QStateMachine machine;
  QState *s1 = new QState();
  QFinalState *s2 = new QFinalState();
  s1->addTransition(&button, SIGNAL(clicked()), s2);
  machine.addState(s1);
  machine.addState(s2);

  QObject::connect(&machine, SIGNAL(finished()), QApplication::instance(), SLOT(quit()));
  machine.setInitialState(s1);
  machine.start();
  \endcode

  \sa QState::finished()

    : QAbstractState(*new QFinalStatePrivate, parent)
