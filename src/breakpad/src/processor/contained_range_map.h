// contained_range_map.h: Hierarchically-organized range maps.
//
// A contained range map is similar to a standard range map, except it allows
// objects to be organized hierarchically.  A contained range map allows
// objects to contain other objects.  It is not sensitive to the order that
// objects are added to the map: larger, more general, containing objects
// may be added either before or after smaller, more specific, contained
// ones.
//
// Contained range maps guarantee that each object may only contain smaller
// objects than itself, and that a parent object may only contain child
// objects located entirely within the parent's address space.  Attempts
// to introduce objects (via StoreRange) that violate these rules will fail.
// Retrieval (via RetrieveRange) always returns the most specific (smallest)
// object that contains the address being queried.  Note that while it is
// not possible to insert two objects into a map that have exactly the same
// geometry (base address and size), it is possible to completely mask a
// larger object by inserting smaller objects that entirely fill the larger
// object's address space.
//
// Internally, contained range maps are implemented as a tree.  Each tree
// node except for the root node describes an object in the map.  Each node
// maintains its list of children in a map similar to a standard range map,
// keyed by the highest address that each child occupies.  Each node's
// children occupy address ranges entirely within the node.  The root node
// is the only node directly accessible to the user, and represents the
// entire address space.
