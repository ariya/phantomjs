// minidump.h: A minidump reader.
//
// The basic structure of this module tracks the structure of the minidump
// file itself.  At the top level, a minidump file is represented by a
// Minidump object.  Like most other classes in this module, Minidump
// provides a Read method that initializes the object with information from
// the file.  Most of the classes in this file are wrappers around the
// "raw" structures found in the minidump file itself, and defined in
// minidump_format.h.  For example, each thread is represented by a
// MinidumpThread object, whose parameters are specified in an MDRawThread
// structure.  A properly byte-swapped MDRawThread can be obtained from a
// MinidumpThread easily by calling its thread() method.
//
// Most of the module lazily reads only the portion of the minidump file
// necessary to fulfill the user's request.  Calling Minidump::Read
// only reads the minidump's directory.  The thread list is not read until
// it is needed, and even once it's read, the memory regions for each
// thread's stack aren't read until they're needed.  This strategy avoids
// unnecessary file input, and allocating memory for data in which the user
// has no interest.  Note that although memory allocations for a typical
// minidump file are not particularly large, it is possible for legitimate
// minidumps to be sizable.  A full-memory minidump, for example, contains
// a snapshot of the entire mapped memory space.  Even a normal minidump,
// with stack memory only, can be large if, for example, the dump was
// generated in response to a crash that occurred due to an infinite-
// recursion bug that caused the stack's limits to be exceeded.  Finally,
// some users of this library will unfortunately find themselves in the
// position of having to process potentially-hostile minidumps that might
// attempt to cause problems by forcing the minidump processor to over-
// allocate memory.
//
// Memory management in this module is based on a strict
// you-don't-own-anything policy.  The only object owned by the user is
// the top-level Minidump object, the creation and destruction of which
// must be the user's own responsibility.  All other objects obtained
// through interaction with this module are ultimately owned by the
// Minidump object, and will be freed upon the Minidump object's destruction.
// Because memory regions can potentially involve large allocations, a
// FreeMemory method is provided by MinidumpMemoryRegion, allowing the user
// to release data when it is no longer needed.  Use of this method is
// optional but recommended.  If freed data is later required, it will
// be read back in from the minidump file again.
//
// There is one exception to this memory management policy:
// Minidump::ReadString will return a string object to the user, and the user
// is responsible for its deletion.
