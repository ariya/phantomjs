// ms_symbol_server_converter.h: Obtain symbol files from a Microsoft
// symbol server, and convert them to Breakpad's dumped format.
//
// At runtime, MSSymbolServerConverter and code that it calls depend on being
// able to locate suitable versions of dbghelp.dll and symsrv.dll.  For best
// results, place these files in the same directory as the executable.
// dbghelp.dll and symsrv.dll as supplied with Debugging Tools for Windows are
// both redistributable, as indicated by the package's redist.txt file.
//
// When connecting to Microsoft's symbol server at
// http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/, which provides access to
// symbols for the operating system itself, symsrv.dll requires agreement to
// Microsoft's "Terms of Use for Microsoft Symbols and Binaries."  Because this
// library places the symbol engine into a promptless mode, the dialog with the
// terms will not appear, and use of Microsoft's symbol server will not be
// possible.  To indicate agreement to the terms, create a file called
// symsrv.yes in the same directory as symsrv.dll.  (Note that symsrv.dll will
// also recognize a symsrv.no file as indicating that you do not accept the
// terms; the .yes file takes priority over the .no file.)  The terms of use
// are contained within symsrv.dll; they were formerly available online at
// http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/symsrvTOU2.mspx , but
// do not appear to be available online any longer as of January, 2007.  It is
// possible to view the terms from within WinDbg (Debugging Tools for Windows)
// by removing any symsrv.yes and symsrv.no files from WinDbg's directory,
// setting the symbol path to include Microsoft's symbol server (.sympath), and
// attempting to load symbols from their server (.reload).
//
// This code has been tested with dbghelp.dll 6.5.3.7 and symsrv.dll 6.5.3.8,
// included with Microsoft Visual Studio 8 in Common7/IDE.  This has also been
// tested with dbghelp.dll and symsrv.dll versions 6.6.7.5 and 6.12.2.633,
// included with the same versions of Debugging Tools for Windows, available at
// http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/ .
