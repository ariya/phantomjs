// A class for producing a vector of google_breakpad::Module::Line
// instances from parsed DWARF line number data.  
//
// An instance of this class can be provided as a handler to a
// dwarf2reader::LineInfo DWARF line number information parser. The
// handler accepts source location information from the parser and
// uses it to produce a vector of google_breakpad::Module::Line
// objects, referring to google_breakpad::Module::File objects added
// to a particular google_breakpad::Module.

// GNU toolchain omitted sections support:
// ======================================
//
// Given the right options, the GNU toolchain will omit unreferenced
// functions from the final executable. Unfortunately, when it does so, it
// does not remove the associated portions of the DWARF line number
// program; instead, it gives the DW_LNE_set_address instructions referring
// to the now-deleted code addresses of zero. Given this input, the DWARF
// line parser will call AddLine with a series of lines starting at address
// zero. For example, here is the output from 'readelf -wl' for a program
// with four functions, the first three of which have been omitted:
//
//   Line Number Statements:
//    Extended opcode 2: set Address to 0x0
//    Advance Line by 14 to 15
//    Copy
//    Special opcode 48: advance Address by 3 to 0x3 and Line by 1 to 16
//    Special opcode 119: advance Address by 8 to 0xb and Line by 2 to 18
//    Advance PC by 2 to 0xd
//    Extended opcode 1: End of Sequence
//

//    Special opcode 76: advance Address by 5 to 0x8 and Line by 1 to 22
//    Advance PC by 2 to 0xa

// Instead of collecting runs of lines describing code that is not there,
// we try to recognize and drop them. Since the linker doesn't explicitly
// distinguish references to dropped sections from genuine references to
// code at address zero, we must use a heuristic. We have chosen:
//
// - If a line starts at address zero, omit it. (On the platforms
//   breakpad targets, it is extremely unlikely that there will be code
//   at address zero.)
//
// - If a line starts immediately after an omitted line, omit it too.
