    \class QAccessiblePlugin
    \brief The QAccessiblePlugin class provides an abstract base for
    accessibility plugins.

    \ingroup plugins
    \ingroup accessibility

    Writing an accessibility plugin is achieved by subclassing this
    base class, reimplementing the pure virtual functions keys() and
    create(), and exporting the class with the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2()
    macro.

    \sa QAccessibleBridgePlugin, {How to Create Qt Plugins}

    Constructs an accessibility plugin with the given \a parent. This
    is invoked automatically by the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro.

    Destroys the accessibility plugin.

    You never have to call this explicitly. Qt destroys a plugin
