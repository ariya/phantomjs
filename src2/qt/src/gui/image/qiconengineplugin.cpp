    \bold {Use QIconEnginePluginV2 instead.}

    The icon engine plugin is a simple plugin interface that makes it easy to
    create custom icon engines that can be loaded dynamically into applications
    through QIcon. QIcon uses the file or resource name's suffix to determine
    what icon engine to use.

    Writing a icon engine plugin is achieved by subclassing this base class,
    reimplementing the pure virtual functions keys() and create(), and
    exporting the class with the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro.

    \brief The QIconEnginePluginV2 class provides an abstract base for custom QIconEngineV2 plugins.

    \ingroup plugins
    \since 4.3
 
    Icon engine plugins produces \l{QIconEngine}s for \l{QIcon}s; an
    icon engine is used to render the icon. The keys that identifies
    the engines the plugin can create are suffixes of 
    icon filenames; they are returned by keys(). The create() function
    receives the icon filename to return an engine for; it should
    return 0 if it cannot produce an engine for the file.

    Writing an icon engine plugin is achieved by inheriting
    QIconEnginePluginV2, reimplementing keys() and create(), and
    adding the Q_EXPORT_PLUGIN2() macro.

    You should ensure that you do not duplicate keys. Qt will query
    the plugins for icon engines in the order in which the plugins are
    found during plugin search (see the plugins \l{How to Create Qt
    Plugins}{overview document}).
